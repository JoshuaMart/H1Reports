Please reach out to support@hackerone.com if you haven't received a message with next steps.\n\n \n\nEmail content :::\n\n \n\nHi 3thic4l,\n\nThanks very much for reaching out to HackerOne. I see you have requested to invite hackers and go live with a private program.\n\nAfter review, your program (████████) is missing some key required elements for approval. In order to start a HackerOne program, you must have:\n\n•             A valid Disclosure Policy that aligns with your reward structure\n\n•             A valid attack surface for researchers to hack that is defined in your program's scope\n\n•             A verified email address that matches your company domain\n\n•             Our security team reserves the right to disallow any company whose properties it deems incompatible with the HackerOne program.\n\nBest,\n\nHackerOne Team\n\n \n\n \n\nYour program is missing some required elements for approval.\n\nSee email from support@hackerone.com for additional detail.\n\n \n\n}}\n\n And also 3 out of 5 researchers who got invited for retest are actually paid 100$ each , so I am not sure Weather it's intended feature or some bug.\n\n2) Email bombing ( excessive spamming - I sent 50 mails in 1 minute using wearehackerone email handle ) in add participant  : ████████\n\nIts like if a program sends an invitation to example@wearehackerone.com , then by using burp intruder multiple invitation email could be sent by altering address as example+1@wearehackerone.com  and so on.\n\n \n\n3) No rate limit on group creation in a program : ████  ( Not really a security issue but there should be some rate limit - As i was able to create 20 groups in 5 secs through burp intruder )\n\n \n\n4) Report Retest feature invites 5 hackers - now i am curious to know weather country check is in place in this feature ( ████ )\n\n \n\nWaiting for your reply on the above mentioned issues.\n\nNote : ( My user handle = 3thic4l  )\n\n \n\nRegards\n\nAhmad\n\n## Impact\n\nMonetary loss to h1 -  coz the person/company accountable is not yet verified.",

      "message": "Hi @3thic4l -\n\n> I never said that this bug has impact on integrity but it has a monetary impact on hackerone itself\n\nIt doesn't have a monetary impact. Either way, it does have a minor impact on integrity. For our programs, we have a special sandbox. This is a mode where programs can test our features, including paying bounties. When a bounty is paid in a sandboxed program, the bounty won't be paid out. Our payments go through a separate system, which only contains programs that are approved (outside of the sandbox) by HackerOne. Even though the bounties may show up in your overview, they won't be paid out.\n\n> 2) Email bombing ( excessive spamming - I sent 50 mails in 1 minute using wearehackerone email handle ) in add participant : ██████████\n\nWe rely on existing rate limits, both in our backend and async job processing. We're OK with the current rate limits, so we wouldn't accept this under our bug bounty program right now.\n\n> 3) No rate limit on group creation in a program : ███████ ( Not really a security issue but there should be some rate limit - As i was able to create 20 groups in 5 secs through burp intruder )\n\nSame answer as the above. Not an immediate security risk for us.\n\n> 4) Report Retest feature invites 5 hackers - now i am curious to know weather country check is in place in this feature ( ██████████ )\n\nThat's fair feedback, I'd assume there isn't. However, the difference between the two situations is that an H1 employee invited those people, whereas with the retest feature, it's the program itself. The documentation is pretty clear in our opinion, so we don't consider this a security vulnerability.\n\n> I am not getting why the severity is low - coz what if a person makes a sandbox program and files 10 reports on his own and then initiate a retest on all ( in that case 50 researchers would be paid 100$ that sums up to 5k$ ) and that i believe is definitely is a big monetary loss on h1.\n\nBecause the user doesn't actually get the money. If it would, we would consider this a medium or high severity vulnerability.",

      "message": "Well @jobert , thanks for clarifying ( I thought the retest bounty is paid in real ) but if it's not then yes it's definitely not a monetary impact whereas you mentioned a \"special sandbox\"  , where programs test your feature but they cannot work with other researchers , right?? \nNow due to this retest feature I was able to communicate with 5 real researchers and they were awarded 100$ retest bounty ( Now as you said this bounty is not paid actually but these researchers must have been notified for this ( \" You have been awarded 100$ for retest \" ) and hence this could lead the researchers to contact hackerone mediation as the program itself would never pay this bounty ) , Now this would impact hackerone integrity . \nLet's say I made 10 reports and initiated retest on all so now 50 researchers will get notified of 100$ bounty after retest ( but they won't actually get it ) so ultimately they'll contact h1 for mediation , which I suppose is impact on integrity.\n\nNow wrt to rate limits : What exactly is the ratelimit at present ?? Or should I check the threshold on my own.\n\n4) I agree with you that the program itself initiate retest  and the documentation is sufficient enough , but sooner or later these region specific programs would ask hackerone to implement a retest feature by keeping in mind thier region restriction. \n\nHappy to help.",
