      "message": "Congratulations! The panel has decided to award you $250 for your bug report. \n\nApologies for the delay. The security was working with the engineering team to revoke the token and also measure the impact of the token leakage as part of our due diligence process. \n\nAfter review the panel concluded that impact of the token leakage is minimal. The key point of discussion:\n1. Corrected the asset. The asset is not app.snapchat.com, it is a public repository (KeyDB) in Github.com\n\n2. The impact of the disclosure is minimal as the token capability was to register a self-hosted runner for the Github actions on the KeyDB public repository. The Github actions enable the self-hosted runners to pull and build the public repository.  Therefore, attackers self-hosted runner would not be able to access Snap's infrastructure.\n\n3. No information/data disclosure. Assuming that a attacker registered their own self-hosted runners using the token. The attacker self-hosted runners would have received action that would let them build the public repository and run the test. In this case the attacker would not gain any sensitive information given that KeyDb is a open source project and the repository is public, so the attacker could read through the source code already. \n\n4. The team verified that token was never misused.\n\nWe appreciate your efforts - thanks, and good luck on your future bug hunting!",

While I appreciate the initial bounty offer, I would like to respectfully request that you reconsider the award amount given the potential risks associated with the leaked credential.\n\nAs an example, let's say an attacker gains access to the token and registers a self-hosted runner on the KeyDB public repository. Even though KeyDB is an open source project and the repository is public, the attacker could modify the code and introduce a malicious payload that could potentially compromise the entire system that uses the self-hosted runner.\n\nFurthermore, if an attacker is able to compromise the self-hosted runner, they could potentially use it to exfiltrate sensitive data or even launch attacks on other systems.\n\nWhile I understand that the impact of the leaked token might appear minimal at first glance, the potential for abuse and exploitation is significant. I hope you can consider my request for a higher bounty given the potential risks associated with this vulnerability. Thank you",
