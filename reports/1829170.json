  "vulnerability_information": "Hi Team,\n\nThere appears to be a weird bug here. Making an API call to the prohibited endpoint appended with double/multiple slash is breaking some server-side restrictions imposed upon a partner account.\n\n**Example** - In the present scenario, Autorebates facility is unavailable to the partners from India. When a direct request is made to the autorebates API endpoint, the application throws `HTTP/2 403 Forbidden`. However, when the similar request is made with double forward slash appended at the beginning, the application successfully processes the request. This effectively gives unrestricted access to the Autorebates facility which otherwise is strictly not available to a partner account from India.\n\n\n#Steps to Reproduce\n\nThe below sample request (appended with double forward slash) attempts to create a client group with set rebate percentage under a partner account which do not have access to the autorebates facility. All requests appended with double forward slash breaks the server-side restriction and easily go through from a partner account with no access to the Autorebates facility.\n\n```\nPOST //api/v2/autorebates/groups/ HTTP/2\nHost: my.exnesstrade.pro\nContent-Type: application/json\nAuthorization: JWT xyz\n\n{\n\"group_title\":\"Test\"\n}\n```\n#Proof of Concept\n███\n\n███\n\n███\n\n## Impact\n\nMaking an API call with double/multiple forward slashes breaks the server-side restrictions imposed upon a partner account and allows a partner to have unrestricted access to the autorebates facility.",

I really appreciate that, but I don't even mind if you still consider closing this report as informative. You can always ask for a reversal of the granted bounty from my H1 account.\n\n>>as an ethical bug hunter, you should report all severe issues which you find, as it describes you as a responsible hunter. \n\nThis thing must work on both sides. Although I never complained but in past there's a quite a few reports which were marked as Informative, and the issues were fixed promptly (refer the latest #1820243 reported 11 days ago). Since I am also personally trading with Exness since over a decade, certain issues specially related to logics if remains unfixed could have benefited me in one way or other in my trading activities (in a pure ethical manner) but reporting it here got me Informative & it might be possible that this happen in future too.\n \nI have nothing to complain about. Just wanted to move on. Thanks :)\n",
