But this check is not implemented in API so the Guest user will be able to the following actions for the Merge request which he don't have a permission.\n\nAllowed Actions in API \n\n- Able to view the title and Description of the Merge Request via   /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid endpoint\n- Get a list of merge request participants via /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/participants\n- Get a list of merge request commits via /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/commits \n- Get  information about the merge request including its files and changes via /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/changes\n- Get a list of merge request pipelines via /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/pipelines\n- Create a TODO for that Merge Request via POST /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/todo\n- Get a list of merge request diff versions via /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/versions\n- Get Merge Request approvals status via /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/approvals\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Add a user a to a project with developer role.\n2. From the Added user account create a Merge Request \n3. From Admin account demote to the user to Guest Role\n4. From the Guest user account try to access the Merge request created by that user. (Merge Request tab will not be available for that user)\n5. Now Create an access token from the Guest user account and try to access the Merge Request created by the user  by the above mentioned any one of the endpoints  (Notice you will be able to view  the Merge Request)\n\n### Impact\n\nGuest Role users have access to Merge Request data that he's not authorised to view and Edit\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nGuest Roles users have access to Merge Request data that he's not authorised to view and Edit via API\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nGuest Roles users should be restricted  access to Merge Request  to view and Edit via API\n\n### Output of checks\n\n This bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n## Impact\n\nGuest Role users have access to Merge Request data that he's not authorised to view and Edit",

Perhaps could you give me access to your testing project so that I can check or I can give access to my testing project to you to simulate the scenario. \n\n >Also, even if the claim that you are making in this report is correct, I am wondering how could this lead to any security risk to our users given that owner is the one how creates the merge request for some reasons and assigns it to a user, which we can perhaps assume that this is the true intention from the owner. userB can then be unassigned by the owner at any time otherwise.\n\n\nThe main reason of demoting a user to Guest role is to restrict data. But The API clearly exposes data that the user is not intended to see. Merge requests sure contain confidential data and I can see that this check is implemented properly on web app but not in the API.\n\n\nThese are the exact steps  followed on my side on gitlab.com\n\n- Created a new Project with private access\n- Created a new file in master branch (Made some changes )\n- Invited a user with a developer role.\n- From the developer role account created a new branch named test, made some changes.\n- After that from project admin account I created a Merge request with source branch as test and target branch as master. \n- Assigned that merge request to the developer role access user.\n- After creating the merge request, from project admin account demoted the developer role user to Guest role\n- From demoted user account  I created a personal access token with all the available scopes selected\n- From API client (Postman) I sent a request to merge_request endpoint you  mentioned. (In that case the merge_request id will be 1 since only one merge request is created)\n- I was able to access the merge request details assigned to demoted user. If i try to access the merge requests which are not assigned to that demoted account. It shows `403 Forbidden`\n\n\n\nLet me know if you need any further details",
