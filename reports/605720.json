Go to `https://hackerone.com/TEAM/groups`\n2. Select the current user's group\n3. Add arbitrary permission (e.g. Admin)\n\n## Additional information disclosure\n\nI noticed that `hackerone.com/teams.json` is accessible to users with \"read-only\" permission, but `https://hackerone.com/TEAM/groups.json` is accessible to users with at least 1 valid permission. \n\nThat's strange because the data is *identical* and **allows disclosing user ids, assigned groups, groups permissions**.\n\nReporting 2 issues in one report, because it's hard to understand the real root cause of the broken RBAC.\n\n## Impact\n\n- A team member with 1 valid permission (except \"readonly\", e.g. Program) can escalate own permissions in the team to arbitrary permissions.\n- \"readonly\" team member can disclose the team's groups, assigned users, groups' permissions and ids/names.",

(unchanged + high privileges requires + full CIA impact)?\n\nHere's what we set for CVSS score: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N`. Though as a team we are still discussing about it, so this might change and if you have additional input please let us know! One particular case we are concerned about is regarding team member of HackerOne, because we use the team member group and permissions to manage the permissions of our internal tooling - which could potentially give them access and privilege to other programs on the platform. \n\n> Just curious, do you have any plans on hiding others' permissions from /teams.json for non-Admin users?\n\nWe are OK with showing the permissions of other team members to all team members. \n\n",

      "message": "Hi @pei and @security ,\n\n**I totally disagree with the bounty and impact**.\n\nI hope that the root cause of this misunderstanding is that H1 forgot that **users with `Admin` permission could assign any permissions to themselves and even create new privileged users**.\n\n**Users with \"Program\" permission have had administrative access in their programs all the time (until Jun 21 2019).**\n\n> For reference:\n{F515471}\n\nI'm not a fan of \"awarding by CVSS\" bureaucracy and especially in this particular case, because this vuln has **more impact than most of the disclosed H1 vulnerabilities**.\n\nJust for references, I compared impact/rewards for other vulnerabilities disclosed by H1 with this bug:\n\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/419896 - Unauthenticated user can upload an attachment to the last updated report draft (CVSS 8.3??! how do you estimate the impact here?)\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/423073 - same impact as in the report above (7.5K, CVSS 7.7!!)\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/386997 - “Private program policy page still accessible after user left the program” (2.5K, CVSS 4.2)\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/380317 - Team object exposes amount of participants in a private program to non-invited users (5K, CVSS 4.4)\n- this report - 2.5K, CVSSv3 5.7 from **your estimation** `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H` (which I consider pretty biased)\n\n## non-HackerOne program\n\nYou estimated this vuln for any program except `hackerone.com/security` as `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/CR:H/IR:H/AR:H` (3.8!!!)\n\n### \"Scope\" -> \"changed\"\n\"Scope\" is \"changed\" (you estimated as \"unchanged\") - broken RBAC allows a user with \"Program\" permissions to edit own permissions and gain \"Admin\" privileges and consequently gain \"Reward\" and \"Report\" permissions for further malicious actions.\n\n### \"Privileges Required\" -> \"Low\"\n- You set \"Privileges Required\" to \"High\".\n- From my experience, \"Program\" permission mostly assigned to program policy managers, lawyers, team managers, and employees responsible for communications with hackers and promotions. \n- Even according to CVSSv3, \"High\" should be set when the user initially has \"administrative\" permissions. In this case, \"Low\" is more appropriative.  \n\n### \"Integrity\" -> \"High\"\nIntegrity was set to \"Low\". Do you mean the bug only impacts the attacked team and not whole H1 or what? How is CIA estimated here?\n\nThe ability to perform actions like **granting arbitrary rewards(monetary impact), untimely disclosing reports, changing APIs, changing permissions** inviting new team members, should make \"Integrity\" set to \"High\".\n\n**That means CVSS score is at least `8.5`** for non-H1 programs. (if \"Privileges Required\" set to \"High\", it's `7.6`)\n\n{F515472}\n\n## Hackerone (and \"internal tooling\")\n\nFrom #343464 (May 2018) it’s publicly known that `hackerone.com/security` has the next team structure:\n```\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"team\": {\n      \"id\": \"Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL1RlYW0vMTM=\",\n      \"name\": \"HackerOne\",\n      \"handle\": \"security\",\n      \"██████\": {\n        \"total_count\": 30\n      },\n      \"team_member_groups\": [\n        {\n          \"id\": \"7506\",\n          \"name\": \"Support\",\n          \"permissions\": [\n            \"support_mutation\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"8126\",\n          \"name\": \"Report Only\",\n          \"permissions\": [\n            \"report_management\"\n          ]\n        },\n        {\n          \"id\": \"8023\",\n          \"name\": \"Support -

(High Privileges + User Interaction)\n- Without impact on \"Availability\" - 7.7, with \"Availability\" impact - 8.0\n\n## Audit? Response? + Summary\n\n1. HackerOne should make an internal audit and notify affected customers.\n2. HackerOne should provide a detailed analysis of this bug (and maybe root cause?)\n\nI think that the assessment of this bug was incomplete and lacks in-depth analysis: \n- wrong CVSS scores and \"speculative\" impact estimation, \n- responses like _\"somewhere in our internal tooling we have some internal checks for some actions by some privileged members\"_\n\n> TBH I consider this bug is one of the most critical bugs among all disclosed reported to H1 vulnerabilities. I hope my point is clear.\n\nThanks.\n\n### P.S.\nI didn't expect such a response from H1.\nIs it just a miscommunication, or H1 discriminates me for some reason? It really feels like discrimination.\nThis report wasn't triaged for 9 days! #614800 was just closed without any explanations.\n",

      "message": "Hi @metnew - thanks for your reply, it's appreciated. I wanted to take a moment to elaborate on our decision. Our internal support application indeed uses HackerOne groups to assign permissions, people are granted access to it based on their membership of @security and their permissions. Our initial assumption was that people with Program Management permission could elevate themselves to an Admin, and then assign any group to themselves. This would give them more access in our Support Application. However:\n\n* The vulnerability only allowed people to elevate their permissions within a program, **when they already had the Program Management permission**. This permission gives a user the ability to do anything, except managing the program's memberships and group memberships. We determined the likelihood of this happening to be Low.\n* For HackerOne's program, seven people were identified who had this particular permission, out of which four didn't have the \"Admin\" permission already. The remaining four were part of other permission groups that had broad access within our Support App.\n* Our Support App contains a feature that allows people to schedule arbitrary commands on production application servers. This feature requires acknowledging an additional Duo (2FA) and another member of the Engineering group to approve the request. Because we use Single Sign-on, it was **not** possible for anyone to register a second account, sign in to the Support App, and approve their own requests. None of the other features in the Support App are considered to have a High impact on Confidentiality. Due to these defenses, we determined the Attack Complexity to be High and User Interaction to be Required. This lowered the severity to a Medium.\n\nWe audited existing programs and determined that, besides you, this was not abused in any approved program (outside of our sandbox).\n\nBecause all the scenarios we played out resulted in a Medium, we opted for the severity that was least complex, didn't require user interaction, and wasn't specific to HackerOne. This scenario only had a Low impact of Confidentiality and Integrity, but still resulted in a Medium severity vulnerability. This is our final decision.\n\nWe thank you for your contributions to our program lately and we look forward to receive more security vulnerabilities from you!\n\nJobert",

For example, assuming the Program user could elevate priveleges to \"Admin\", they could **force disclosure of all reports in the program**. Such an impact should be considered severe for both H1 (as a business) and the program. Another example of severe impact is monetary impact.\n\nThanks.",

The Support App is the same code base as hackerone.com. It's a Rails Engine that is mounted on `/support` when a particular environment variable is set. We run a number of application servers, of only a few have that flag set and are only accessible through our VPN. I don't think that this affects other systems outside of https://hackerone.com / https://hackerone.com/support.\n\n> High impact on Integrity\n\nUnfortunately, it's subjective. We decided that when it only affects a single program, we consider the impact on the integrity of our data to be Low. We're sure that there are exceptions to this rule, but we haven't seen them yet.\n\nHave a good day!",

      "message": "Hi @jobert,\n\nThanks again for the reply! I hope that will be the last message.\n\nI understand that the threat model of H1 is something similar to \"storage of **private** security issues\". \nProbably, it's correct to say that one of the main goals of H1 as a platform is to provide private communication between programs and researchers.\n\nI think I was able to find a way to explain how this vulnerability could impact other systems.\n\n### Business/legal/Intellectual impact for program/H1/researchers\n\n1. <Privilege escalation>\n2. Attacker **discloses all reports publicly**. That's a very impactful thing for programs like Dropbox/Github (which don't disclose reports until a request from the reporter) and programs which disallow public disclosure. \n3. The potential impact for the program (company) may vary. It'll definitely lead to business inquiries from customers, \"impact on the brand\" in news, probably something bad will happen with the program's compliance.\n4. From another side, public disclosure breaks the confidentiality of finders' researches. That's obviously **impactful for reporters**, which often don't want to disclose and share their techniques.\n4. The fact that confidentiality of customer's (and finders') reports was violated (publicly!) should reflect HackerOne as a business too. And probably it may violate ToS.\n5. Note that, if the attacker discloses reports as \"readonly\" user via \"export\" feature, there will be no evidence that these reports are actually leaked. And H1 isn't responsible in this case, the program is. **Any user could export reports, but not anyone could disclose them**.\n\n#### TL;DR: \n\n0. <PrivEsc> -> Full public disclosure of all reports.\n1. H1 as a platform doesn't behave in this case as \"private storage of the reports and researches\"\n2. Business impact for the company: compliance/business customers/news/legal.\n3. Finders' intellectual property violation: techniques and researches are publicly accessible.\n4. Attackers achieved this impact via a vulnerability in HackerOne. \n5. All the reports are publicly accessible on the main page (`/hacktivity`) of Hackerone!\n6. HackerOne is definitely responsible here and it's likely H1 will suffer from the **legal impact.**\n7. Huge scandalous.\n\n### Triagers deanonymization\nOn \"Managed\" programs, groups admins (only users with **Admin** permission) can see triagers' emails. H1 triagers' emails have a form of \"<name>@managed.hackerone.com\" or \"<first_letter_of_the_name><lastname>@managed.hackerone.com\". Also, admins see emails of all other members of their team.\n\n I don't have access to \"Enterprise plan\", but \"custom integrations\" and \"hierarchical programs\" sound very interesting to search for an additional impact. Some integrations even in the \"Professional\" plan could be **bidirectional**.\n\n> Initially, I considered RBAC as a (vulnerable) component, a vulnerability in which allows members with \"Program\" permission to run actions of \"Reward/Admin/Report\" groups. So if my assumption is correct, \"Scope\" of the bug is \"changed\", assuming a program is a self-contained system. However, considering a single program **only** as a part of H1 platform, I would agree with your statement (except for integrations/hierar.\n\n\n> TBH I strongly believe that this vulnerability is much more impactful compared to vulnerabilities like \"some component allows uploading attachments to draft reports\".",
