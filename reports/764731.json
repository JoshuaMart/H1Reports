  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nA publicly accessible Grafana install exposes semi sensitive Dashboards. This also exposes the Prometheus proxied datasources which allow direct queries to a Prometheus instance which reveals sensitive data an opens the instance up to potential DoS via crafted requests.\n\n**Description:**\n\n## Impact\nMedium-Low\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Grafana instance - https://████████/stats/\n2. Example semi sensitive dashboard: https://████████/stats/d/███/\n3. This dashboard reveals an unrestricted Prometheus proxy API at https://███/stats/api/datasources/proxy/1/api/v1/\n4. This API can be queried in many ways to include resource intensive queries which could result in a DoS. An example of exposed datasets:\nhttps://██████/stats/api/datasources/proxy/1/api/v1/label/__name__/values. A query crafted to require high resource usage would result in a denial of service.\n5. This can reveal much more sensitive data as well such as internal ip addresess assigned to interfaces https://████/stats/api/datasources/proxy/1/api/v1/query?query=node_network_address_assign_type\n\n or\n\n`curl -s 'https://██████/stats/api/datasources/proxy/1/api/v1/query?query=node_network_address_assign_type' |     python2 -c \"import sys, json; print json.load(sys.stdin)['data']['result'][0]\"`\n (Ip addresses are in decimal)\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n Grafana v6.4.4 \n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nImplement controls to disallow public access\n\n## Impact\n\nDenial of Service\nUtilize exposed network and device data for network reconnaissance",
