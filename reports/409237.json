This is not Brute force, brute force would be the requirement of guessing a username and a password in order to archive a valid combination which will result in access to an authenticated area\n\n2. IDOR must be a parameter and can be anywhere (in cookie, in string, ..) however when changing the value of its parameter the impact must result in Improper Access Control (Unauthenticated Access to an area restricted for the legitimate/default user) which in our case we managed to access ██████@██████.com (witch was not an account i made, i have no clue what its password is) the result of this can be many different things but mainly Information Disclosure or some state changing operation.\n\nSo again, please reconsider this for i have reason to believe you have miscalculated the severity of this flaw.\nIts no problem, mistakes happen... but damn, your scaring me right now.\n\nIf after this appeal you still disagree with the IDOR vulnerability than you should atleast make this Improper Access Control (Broken Authentication) since i am able to access other users data by just changing the e-mail parameter's value.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nBest Regards,\nJoel Aviad Ossi",

Register any e-mail, for instance: ag3nt-z3@███  , Note: it will ask for mail verification, but the trick is to get passed this\n\n2. We login with one of our ██████ accounts through: https://██████/███\nE-Mail: █████████\nPassword: ████████\n\n3. Now the link in the address bar looks like this: https://█████████/████\n\nEdit the value in the email parameter to the mail you would like to login to and press enter.\n\n4. Boom!
