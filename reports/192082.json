See screenshot below. In this case, if the attacker knows where the victim wants to live 'the most', they can orchestrate a verification process asking the same question three times.\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1.  Click on the forgot password link, and modify the url such that the rq parameter is the number of the question for which there is a known answer (in this case 02): https://█████/PinLetterConfirm.aspx?globalID=DNET000720161122131230W0821236&AccessString=DJMSAA~||DMDAA,CV,PRI|AKO,CV,ALT||ALERT,1,1,1,1,1||Answers=8%27%22&att=Initial&rq=02,02,02\n2.\n3.\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions",
