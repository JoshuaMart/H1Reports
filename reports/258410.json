  "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nMany DoD systems use BlueCoat gateways. These gateways insert unique BlueCoat ids that permit tracking DoD users and gaining insight into the DoD network architecture when DoD users access the Internet.\n\n**Description:**\nI run a popular web service (FotoForensics.com -- it's around 150,000 in the Alexa list of top web sites).  My public web site is explicitly for research and gets visitors from all over, including from the DoD.  One of the research project collects non-standard HTTP headers.  The BlueCoat HTTP headers immediately stood out as non-standard.\n\nSomeone with a BlueCoat gateway will have headers that look like:\n\n> POST /upload-file.php HTTP/1.1\n> Host: www.fotoforensics.com\n> Content-Length: 70869\n> Cache-Control: max-age=0\n> Origin: http://www.fotoforensics.com\n> Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36\n> Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryPaSgeQQ5m6kh7aaZ\n> Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\n> Referer: http://www.fotoforensics.com/\n> Accept-Language: en-█████████,en;q=0.8\n> ██████████: ██████ (███) SC\n> Connection: Keep-Alive\n> █████████: █████████\n\n(This example came from a user at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.)\n\nThe id found on the \"██████████\" line is unique to the Bluecoat device; it is not unique to the user. However, if this ID ever shows up at a different network address, then it permits a remote (outside of DoD) system to identify associated network addresses, multiple proxy exits, and potentially non-attributable networks. Similarly, if a single IP address is associated with multiple Bluecoat ids, then it denotes a single exit proxy and identifies the (minimum) number of subnets that use the proxy.\n\nFor example:\n\n> █████████\n> ██████\n> ██████████\n> █████████\n> ████████\n> ██████\n> ██████████\n\nMy server has seen this one IP address associated with 7 different Bluecoat devices.\n\n> ███\n> ████\n> █████████\n> ██████████\n\nThis single bluecoat ID has been linked to four different network addresses.\n\n> ███\n> ████████\n\nThis bluecoat id (████) is interesting because it has been seen on two very different subnets.\n\n> █████████\n> ███\n\nThis bluecoat ID moved locations: it was seen in████ and in/near ███████. (Imagine what it could tell an observer if it were to suddenly appear in █████████...)\n\nI have currently collected 243 bluecoat IDs associated with \"████████\". In addition, I've collected 120 bluecoat IDs from the █████████ Group, 71 ids from the \"Headquarters, ██████████AISC\", and ids from many other government organizations.\n\nFor example:\n> ██████\n> ███\n> █████\n> █████\n> █████\n\nThis one bluecoat id has been observed with both the Department of the Interior and with ██████████GS. The first 3 ip addresses have hostnames that say \"usgs.gov\", but the others either lack hostnames or are from the national parks service (nps.gov). And this one id is from 5 IP addresses that span 4 different subnets.\n\n## Impact\nDoD uses Bluecoat gateways with unique IDs enabled. The unique IDs are supposed to prevent proxy forwarding loops between Bluecoat devices. However, they permit external observers from (1) determining that a Bluecoat device is in use, (2) tracking the device, and (3) gaining insight into the DoD network architecture.\n\nWhen combined with user-agent strings and other distinct and unique identifiers, this combination of ID and IP address permits determining who likely works with whom.\n\n(Let me know if you want the full list for DoD bluecoat devices. And if you want them for other ██████ Gov/Mil groups, let me know.)\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nIt varies by Bluecoat device, but buried in each system's configuration menu is an option to disable the unique ID. These should be disabled everywhere.\n",

Full disclosure here, this report was filed when a different team were handling things on the technical side here on the program.  After reviewing your report I probably would have handled it a little different from our end.  As what you have found is a misconfiguration of Bluecoat applicances within the DoD and things like WAFs and loadbalancers tend to fall outside of our scope.  And your finding here looks to be an issue at the enterprise level which is also out of our scope.  I'm going to need to work with our director to determine how we can push the issue.  We tend to process these type of things out as valid and close them as resolved and work them internally due to scope and the impact to how long it takes to address these type of issues...as you can see with the length of time this report has already been opened.\n\nIf you can give me a fresh example of this happening and an endpoint I can interact with that would be helpful to try and breath some new life into this report.",

And there's a few instances of the same IP with multiple bluecoats behind it (load balancing internal, one external).\n\nBluecoat ███, ███, and ██████ are really interesting since each spans multiple ASNs.\n\nBeyond this, I can potentially fingerprint browsers. If I were to do this (I'm not, but if I did), then I could estimate the users behind the subnets, work hours, and more.\n\n\n",

Could have used it a few months ago when I was looking for something to quickly get to exif data rather than the CLI tool in Kali.  So your report is unique as you gather the information disclosure from your server logs from DoD and ███G endpoints.  We're all back from the holiday weekend here and I will be discussing with the director on how best to address this.  As this is a misconfiguration with the Bluecoat from many sites including those within the ██████G and DoD I am not real sure how we are going to proceed.  Similar issues we've pushed up to an enterprise level for the system owners to make their own determiniations.  As this type of finding is outside of our scope there isn't much more we can do.  Give me a few days and I'll get a response back to you.",

      "message": "This bug report was marked as \"high\" by DoD, and hasn't been acted on in over a year. I don't mind writing it up publicly on my blog. But if you're going to fix it, or send out notices to every impacted group so they can deal with it, then I'll give you more time.\n\nLast I heard (from Sep 17) was that DoD wanted to keep this bug open. However, I haven't seen anything to tell me that the DoD has acted on this issue.\n\nI guess the real question is: How would DoD like to proceed?\nA few options:\n\n1. Pay me the bounty and you own the bug.\n\n2. Send notices out to all DoD branches (and preferably all gov sysadmins) and give them time to address it. I can even send you a large list of ████ Gov IP-to-Bluecoat mappings.\n\n3. Close it out as no fix and I blog about it. If I blog, I will be very detailed, with IP and bluecoat ID mappings. But I would do DoD as well as lots of foreign nations. E.g., I have a collection of Iranian bluecoat IDs. You can tell when an IP is from an Iranian gov user because they DO NOT have bluecoat IDs. (Iranian citizens go through Bluecoat; Iranian govies do not.)\n\nI'm open to other options, if you have suggestions.\n\nIf I blog about it, then lots of admins will learn about it very quickly. Given the time of year, I'd probably blog about it as my 1st or 2nd blog entry of 2019. (IMHO, it's not polite to make everyone panic right before they head off for the holidays.)\n\nHow would you like to proceed on this report?",
