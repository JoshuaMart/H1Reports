When victim1@test.com follows the email instructions to sign into the account, I see that they are logged in as victim1@test.com. Not as victim2@test.com.\n\nThe user management page will show victim2@test.com as the new user until victim1@test.com logs in, at which point it will revert back to victim1@test.com.\n\nIs that what you're seeing as well?\n\nIf a new email was generated for victim2@test.com and the link sent to victim1@test.com allowed that user to login as victim2@test.com, I would see that as being very problematic but I'm not seeing that behavior.\n\nTo me, it seems like this works like I would expect. An admin mistakenly invites victim1@test.com and that user is able to log into the account. Once that happens, an admin could review the list of users and they would see that victim1@test.com, the incorrect user, is a member.\n\nHopefully that makes sense. Let me know if I can clarify my question.\n\nThanks,\nDaniel",
