  "vulnerability_information": "Hi,\n\n## Description\nI have found that it is possible to add external login service even if the email address is not verified. This allows someone to create an account with an email he does not own and create some kind of backdoor accounts that would allow him to get access to shops and more.\n\nIn the external login services of the profil, it is said that **You do not have an external login service connected to your Shopify ID. Please verify your email address to connect a login service.**. So one should not be able to connect and external login account if the email was not verified.\n\n{F1051426}\n\n## Steps de reproduce\n1. Create a new account at `partners.myshopify.com` with the victim email (saltymermaid+victim@wearehackerone.com)\n\n2.  The account is created, now go to your profile at  https://accounts.shopify.com/accounts/{account_id}`\n\n3. In the external login service section or anywhere else in the page, with your browser developper console, add the following HTML snippet `<a href=\"/accounts/{victim_account_id}/external-login/1\" data-method=\"post\">Connect to Google</a>` and replace the **{victim_account_id}** with the victim's account id from the url.\n\n4. Now click on the link you injected in the page and it will bring you too the google account authentication page\n\n5. Connect to your google account or create a new one. You will be redirected to the victims account uppon success.\n\n6. Notice that the external login account was added even if the email was not verified.\n\n7. Now, on another browser, go to https://partners.shopify.com/organizations, enter the victims email address and notice that **Log in with Google** button is shown. You should be able to connect that the \"backdoor\" account.\n\n## Impact\n\nAbility to create backdoors login accounts via external login services for an account that was not verified could lead to important information disclosures. I think the chances of this happening  are low since a victim would be carreful after receiving the shopify confirmation email but in somes cases, this could lead to important leak of informations.\n\nIf you need extra details, just le me know. I will make a POC video soon.\n\nThank you.",

The victim's received an unexpected greeting message from Shopify with a confirmation email. Since the victim doesn't know the password, he decide to \"take over\" the account by making a password reset request. The request is sent to his email account, he opens up the password request, change the password and logs into the account. The account is verified at the same time and at that point, the victim could think that he is safe. Some time later, the victim have a new job where he is invited to manage a shopify store and uses that account because he thinks that the attacker would never be able to access his account anymore. The victims accept the invite and start managing the store. Not long after, the attacker log in to the victims account with that \"backdoor\" account and access the store.",

      "message": "Hi @saltymermaid,\nThanks again for your report! \nWe're awarding a $1,600 bounty for this issue. Please find below our rationale generated using our [CVSS calculator](https://shopify.github.io/appsec/cvss_calculator/). We have set Attack Complexity to High, as there are significant factors beyond an attacker's control here. They must create an account under a target user's email, and must wait for that user to signup or receive an invite. There is User Interaction required in this case, as the targeted user would find that they already have a Shopify ID account, and would have to explicitly reset the password. This results in a Low Confidentiality and Integrity impact, as this only affects a subset of users (those without an existing Shopify ID account).\n\n# Base Score CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N 4.2\n# Environment: Core\n\n### Attack Complexity: H\n* Specific conditions or measurable effort to exploit?: Yes\n\n### Privileges Required: N\n* Requires privileged account (not self-registered)?: No\n\n### User Interaction: R\n* Requires victim to perform some action during exploit?: Yes\n\n### Scope: U\n* Can the attacker impact a separate service?: No\n\n### Confidentiality: L\n* How much data could be accessed?: Most or All\n* How much of Shopify is impacted?: Some\n\n### Integrity: L\n* How much data could be changed?: Most or All\n* How much of Shopify is impacted?: Some\n\n### Availability: N\n* Level of disruption to network service?: None",
