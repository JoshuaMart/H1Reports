  "vulnerability_information": "The following Python library has been installed on at least one Yelp owned build server directly from the public PyPI registry.\n\n* https://pypi.org/project/yelp-cgeom/\n\nThis package should normally be downloaded from the internal Yelp registry, but a misconfiguration appears to have caused it to be downloaded from `pypi.org` instead.\n\nThis package name was previously unclaimed on PyPI. In order to detect such misconfigurations, I have uploaded my own code under the `yelp-cgeom` name.\n\nWhenever `yelp-cgeom` is installed, my `setup.py` script is executed on the machine where it is downloaded. The script sends a callback to my server containing:\n\n* the originating IP\n* the machine's hostname\n* the current working directory\n\nTo avoid breaching the program policy, no further actions are taken.\n\n# Vulnerable machine\n\nAt `Wed jul 29 2020 04:27:23 GMT`, and again 20 seconds later, I have received the following callback:\n\n* originating IP: `54.71.19.248`\n* hostname: `10-81-21-60-uswest2bdevc.uswest2-devc.yelpcorp.com`\n* home directory: `/nail/home/jenkins`\n* directory: `/ephemeral/tmpdir/pip-install-o6jnSv/yelp-cgeom`\n\nThis indicates that my preinstall script was executed on the server above.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf this package had been claimed by an attacker, this would have led to arbitrary code execution on the affected server, as well as allowing the attacker to add backdoors inside the affected project(s) during the build process.",

Please feel free to make the answers as detailed or as vague as you feel comfortable. \"No comment\" is a valid answer too :)\n\n\n1.

      "message": "Hi Alex,\n\nYes, that’s accurate: the root cause of this specific vulnerability was that a subset of our services did not explicitly declare that they should fetch packages from our internal PyPi. We were able to mitigate this through pushing a change to configure the default index-server for PyPi at /etc/pip.conf in our Docker images, so that developers would need to explicitly fetch from the public index-server if desired.\n\nWe were able to work with our core teams and patch the immediate vulnerability within a day. We were also able to quickly identify erroneous traffic and non-conforming services through our telemetry systems across our hosts. Finally, we will be continuing to develop tooling and alerts to mitigate this set of supply chain attacks in the future.\n\nThank you for bringing this to our attention, and cooperating with us as we addressed this vulnerability.\n\nBest,\nThe Yelp Security Team",
