(Refer: Screenshot 1)\n—>Now visit the swag link ie. ██████████ and add a parameter there ██████████ \n—> link becomes : ████████\n—>You will get the PII of researchers.  (Refer: Screenshot 2)\n\n##Fix\n1.)████████ should be informed that the data might have leaked. \n2.)Link should be redacted.\n3.) When hackerone provides swag to researchers they should mention to keep the link strictly confidential , \nsame information should also be provided to the programs on HackerOne , that offer swag.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can get sensitive information about the other researchers like their addresses and phone number.",

You happened to find someone else's ███████ URL, but this is highly unlikely (unless I'm missing something). We're planning to make some changes to our process so people know that the URLs should be kept to themselves as well.\n\nI agree that the probability of this being exploited at large scale is very less, However as I mentioned earlier I reported this because H1 didn't mentioned anywhere that the link is supposed to treated as a secret and also the 2nd reason was that ████████ is one of my favourite researchers, so I was overjoyed when I  saw his details through this issue. \n\nI also want to ask if this report is elegible for bounty, from my side I think it should be because to completely resolve this there are some changes required from HackerOne's side as well \n\nThank you \n ",

Not mentioning that the URLs are sensitive feels a bit implied, so I'm not super confident yet that we're considering that to be a security vulnerability, but I'll discuss it with a few others. Until then though, ████████ is very thankful about you reporting the security vulnerability and wanted to send you some swag. They gave me the following link: ████████. No worries, I don't have your email address, so I won't be able to see your address (haha). One thing the asked me to pass along: a user is only required to enter their email address again after 10 minutes have passed, so keep that in mind when retesting the vulnerability and checking out the new flow. Let me know if you have any feedback for them that you want me to pass along.",
