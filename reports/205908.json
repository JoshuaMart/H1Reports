  "vulnerability_information": "We have set up a ldap user filter to match only those users in our ldap directory which should get access to nextcloud. User count shows correct number of users as expected and the filter correctly shows only the users we want in an ldapsearch.\n\nThe ldap directory contains a lot of other accounts which don't match that filter and which should not get access to nextcloud. However, now we found out that it is possible for any valid user account in the ldap directory to log into nextcloud. The account is set up and login is successful even through the account does not match the filter.\n\nThe account won't be listed on the Users page of an nextcloud admin user, thus from that view the account doesn't exist.\n\nI have just tested it with 11.0.1 (centos7, installed from rpms) and I was able to log in with a test account which does not match the user filter...\n",

Also the possibility it enables a way to lock out users from this specific service when enriched with an attribute while keeping all its shares to other users in tact.\n\nWell, if that's what you want I would rather go the opposite direction: enter two filters to clearly distinguish between \"public\" and \"hidden\" entries but keep the login attribute filter for the purpose of mapping the username entered by the user to the ldap entries.\n\nFor a standard setup the Users tab would be the userlist filter for all users allowed to log into the server.\n\nThe login attribute tab is the mapping which will be added to the userlist filter when used. Do it as a filter as it is now (with the filter always ANDed to the userlist filter) or set it up as simple list of attribute names to be used to find the username.\n\nThe hidden user feature should be advanced or expert setting only. Here you could define an additional filter based on which entries are hidden. This way the hidden list is always a subset of the full userlist.\n\nOf course, the hidden entries should never be hidden from an administrative account, i.e. all accounts should be visible on the Users page of an admin. Right now, not even the admin sees those \"hidden\" account thus you can't set a quota or assign them to a group...\n\nIn the same manner you could also have an additional advanced/expert configuration for locked out accounts. Many ldap servers already have some attribute for this purpose (e.g. nsAccountLock, which will probably prevent a successful bind to this entry anyway). Thus with this additional lockout filter you can define which of all existing userlist entries should not be able to log in.\n\nThis way you  have a simple and clear setup for most standard cases (user filter and the login map filter). For advanced use it's possible to hide and lock out some entries based on any additional filters. I'd say this way it's pretty hard to set it up incorrectly...",
