  "vulnerability_information": "Dear DoD - Team,\nI am able to execute javascript code on www.███████/News/Speeches.\n\nThis endpoint has a search functionality with the parameter `Search`. The supplied value to this parameter gets embedded into the website.\nFurthermore the frontend of the website is presumably created with a template engine. These engines handle user supplied data within double curly braces `{{...}}` for example. If the user input is not sanitized corretly template injection can occur.\n\nWhen supplying the `Search` parameter with a value inside double curly braces it gets evaluated and the result is then embedded into the web page.\n\nFor example the search value `www.███████/News/Speeches?Search={{7*7}}` gets evaluated to `49` and put into the web page (see image_1.png).\nBesides simple mathematical equations, javascript code can be put inside those braces too (see image_2.png). This will execute the code as well which results in a XSS vulnerability.\n\nThere are some mitigations to this. For example some methods are blacklisted which means alert(1) is not allowed. However this can be bypassed by encoding the payload into a base64 string and call a decode method before evaluating (executing) the code.\n\nI've come up with a simple payload which triggers all javascript code thus bypassing the blacklisting of potential dangerous methods.\n\n`https://www.████/News/Speeches/?Search={{window['eval'](window['atob'](window['decodeURIComponent']('BASE_64_ENCODED_PAYLOAD')))}}`\n\nA poc video is attached.\n\n## Recap\n\nA client side template injection vulnerability is present through the `Search` parameter. This leads to the ability to run arbitrary javascript code on the client side.\n\n## Impact\n\n- run arbitrary javascript code on the victims machine\n- Since the javascript code is run within the realm of ██████ CORS bypass on other endpoints could be possible.\n- Forgery of information\n\n## System Host(s)\nwww.█████████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\n\n\n## CVE Numbers\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n- Copy the provided link in the description section\n- Replace the `BASE_64_ENCODED_PAYLOAD` with an actual base64 encoded javascript code. For Example `YWxlcnQoMSk=` which is `alert(1)` in base64.\n - Insert the crafted url into the browser.\n- done\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nSanitize the user input so double curly braces `{{...}}` won't trigger a client side server injection\n\n",
