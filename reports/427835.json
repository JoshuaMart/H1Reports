The requests can be directed to external websites as well as the internal network. \n\nAn attacker can use this vulnerability to exfiltrate data from the internal network that is not protected by other mechanisms, or to perform actions in the name of the server in the internal network which do not contain other protection mechanisms (reduced security is common in internal networks).\n\nAn attacker can also use this issue to scan the internal network as well as external websites for further vulnerabilities.\n\nA user account is required, but it does not require extended permissions.\n \nPOC\n---\n\n    GET /nextcloud/nextcloud/index.php/apps/calendar/v1/proxy?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fsecret HTTP/1.1\n\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    [...]\n    secret\n\nThe \"secret\" file is an example of a file located in the internal network that is not protected by further authentication. Its content is displayed in full and as-is (the same is true for more complex files). \n\nSolution\n--------\n\nThe given URL should be verified before making a request. If it is pointing to a private address, the request should not be performed. To reduce the impact of potential misuse of the host as a scanner, requests could be throttled.\n\nAdditionally, the impact of the issue could be reduced by processing the response server-side instead of client-side. Instead of displaying the entire HTTP response to the client, the response could be parsed and validated to ensure that it is in a calendar format. This way, non-calendar/ics information from internal networks would not leak to an attacker.\n\n## Impact\n\nexfiltrate data from the internal network and perform actions in the name of the server in the internal network",

      "message": "Hi @rullzer ,\n\nthanks for getting back to me on this!\n\nI can confirm that the fix severely reduces the impact of the issue. I couldn't bypass it to read any files that do not start with `BEGIN:VCALENDAR` or `BEGIN:VCARD` (and also otherwise parse properly; the extension of the file doesn't matter, but it's highly unlikely that non-vcalendar/vcard files would start with these strings). \n\nIt is still possible to perform a portscan of the internal network and to perform other requests to the internal network from the given server (see eg [here](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/182739/what-can-be-done-with-blind-ssrf)) though. And ICS files could of course still be taken from the internal network.\n\nBecause of this, I would still suggest to additionally filter out private network ranges - and optionally provide a configuration option (with a security notice in the documentation) to enable it if absolutely required. \n\nBest,\nFoobar7",
