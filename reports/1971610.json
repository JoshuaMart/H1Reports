Here I just click icon and see logged in without knowing credentials (with private mode, etc - as above).\n\nScenario - impact: you can click (also upper right) \"Go to Weblate\" and will be logged in also on https://hosted.weblate.org/\nThat means, you (bad actor) can go to https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/profile/#account and see PII - name surname email address, and other informations connected with account Settings. Please keep in mind that can also make all of the actions where password confirmation are not needed, like in general normal service activity (ie. changing content).\n\nProposed remediation: after logging out, when user want to logging in - should prove that knows proper credentials - typing login and password.\n\nI hope it will be useful.
