Here I just click icon and see logged in without knowing credentials (with private mode, etc - as above).\n\nScenario - impact: you can click (also upper right) \"Go to Weblate\" and will be logged in also on https://hosted.weblate.org/\nThat means, you (bad actor) can go to https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/profile/#account and see PII - name surname email address, and other informations connected with account Settings. Please keep in mind that can also make all of the actions where password confirmation are not needed, like in general normal service activity (ie. changing content).\n\nProposed remediation: after logging out, when user want to logging in - should prove that knows proper credentials - typing login and password.\n\nI hope it will be useful.

It is correct.\n\nWrong is with action logging out on \"weblate.org\" - because from this site we can have access to \"hosted.weblate\" (sessionid will be the same), but here we can logging out and logging in again without credentials (like in the loop; just clicking button) - as described above.\n\nLong story short, in my opinion for weblate.org should be similar like for hosted.weblate - when logged out - user should type credentials to logging in again.\n\nI hope it will be useful.
