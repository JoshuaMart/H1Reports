  "vulnerability_information": "The groupfolders tarball contains the phpunit code in the vendor directory (https://github.com/nextcloud/groupfolders/releases/download/v6.0.2/groupfolders.tar.gz) .\nAs discussed on https://thephp.cc/news/2020/02/phpunit-a-security-risk this really is a potential security risk.\nThe phpunit code contains a file called `eval-stdin.php` which evaluates the contents of `php://stdin`.\nNote that the same issue was discovered in PrestaShop which according to thephp.cc claims:\n\n```\nI was contacted by the vendor of PrestaShop, an Open Source E-Commerce software, on January 6, 2020. They informed me that eval-stdin.php can be exploited for remote code execution when PHPUnit is publicly available on the web server and FastCGI is used to integrate PHP with that web server.\n```\n\nI was not able to exploit this using different FastCGI configurations. However, again according to phpcc:\n\n```\nAn HTTP post payload can only be accessed via the php://stdin stream if PHP is used by the web server via CGI or FastCGI. I was not sure if php://stdin really behaves like this, so I reached out to PHP core developers. Joe Watkins and Christoph M. Becker were able to confirm that php://stdin behaves like this and that its implementation is based on the specifications for CGI and FastCGI, which mandate access to the request payload via the standard input stream.\n```\n\nIf the Nextcloud is configured so that the url still contains `index.php` I was able to access the `eval-stdin.php` file without authentication.\nNote that the following apps also include the phpunit package:\n - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/carnet\n - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/discoursesso\n - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/extract\n\n## Impact\n\nAccording to the PHP core developers and PrestaShop the `eval-stdin.php` makes it possible to perform RCE.\nMy research shows that in at least certain circumstances (i.e., index.php is not rewritten) the `eval-stdin.php` file is accessible.",
