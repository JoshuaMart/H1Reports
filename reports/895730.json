That user is the only user in that new, separate group. Log in as N. Click on contacts menu (next to the user menu). One sees all contacts of A. One shouldn't see any.\n\nThis is relevant since it is unexpected and NC lacks a means to restrict viewing of such contact data. This may lead to a GDPR relevant data breach. (In my case, it did!) IF data were COPIED to B (cached?, not sure), this would be even worse.\n\nDeleting the federation solves the issue (but breaks functionality otherwise desired). I propose to add further restriction selections (for contacts from federated servers) to sharing.\n\nSidenote: The way it is now also has a functional glitch: If one clicks in the info \"i\" next to one contact from a federated server, the \"contacts\" app opens and shows an error \"No such contact found\"…\n\n## Impact\n\nWell, what SECURITY impact? It's a PRIVACY impact. But since Nextcloud strives to be the privacy-friendly alternative to big players…\n\nOK: Impact is simple contact information disclosure. But to make clear what dimensions this could lead to: Imagine all business contact information in A (in my case >1000 contacts), readable to completely unrelated people on another instance.",

For example this will be used to auto-complete external users for federated sharing.\n\nMaybe the \"restrict sharing/autocomplete\" settings description need adjustment to make clear that they only apply to local users/groups. Otherwise this also makes no sense really. Why would you trust a server to ease autocomplete, when no one can autocomplete?\n\nSo to fix your case, you should remove the trusted server and then disable `Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully`\n\nPS: This is just my quick feedback and I will ping the sharing expert to confirm this.",
