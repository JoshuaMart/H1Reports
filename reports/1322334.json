  "vulnerability_information": "Hey y'all! ðŸ‘‹ Hope all is well!\n\n## Summary:\nIn testing Tumblr's Post+, I've found that it's possible to subscribe to creators that, at one point, opted into Post+ but had opted out after some point. As I note later on, it appears that this is a \"one time use only\" as the Payment URL becomes invalid after activating Post+ for the inactive Post+ blog.\n\n## Platform(s) Affected:\nN/A\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nIn order to reproduce, you need the `blogMembershipsId` of an inactive Post+ blog. This creates a high bar to actually exploit this but, for some reason, I had the `blogMembershipsId` of `â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ`, who had deactivated Post+ shortly after launch (the membership ID is `â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ`).\n\n1. Get an active Post+ subscription URL (I used `â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ.tumblr.com`'s subscription URL).\n2. Replace the active Post+ blog's `blogMemershipsId` with the inactive blog's `blogMembershipsId` (if using `â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ`, you should have a url like `https://â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ.payment.tumblr.com/checkout/?token=<token>`).\n    * As a heads up, it actually looks like this URL is no longer valid after activating my Post+ subscription for `â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ`.\n3. Complete checkout as normal.\n4. After checkout, it will redirect back to the active Post+ blog's creator page but it will never load.\n5. Verify that the creator page for the previously inactive Post+ blog is active again and that the subscription is active for the inactive Post+ blog.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\nUnfortunately, this looks like a \"one time use\" only vulnerability as the WooCommerce payment URL is no longer active for `â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ` after I attempted to subscribe so I was unable to get a PoC video. However, I've uploaded the receipt in case having the `payment_intent` ID helps at all!\n\n## Impact\n\nAs of right now, the only impact I've been able to see is that the inactive Post+ blog's creator page became active, even without them enrolled into Post+: https://www.tumblr.com/creator/â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ. However, I would also consider the fact that a page would show the blog name & avatar for the Post+ blog noted in the token but the checkout URL corresponds to the `blogMembershipsId` as unexpected behavior but, as far as I can tell, it would be somewhat of a \"self-pwn\" ðŸ˜….\n\nIf y'all don't necessarily consider this a security risk, please let me know and I will self-close this report! To be honest, with what I can see, I consider this to be fairly low impact but I wanted to let y'all know anyway. ðŸ™‚",
