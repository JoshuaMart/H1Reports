The `/reports/bulk` endpoint doesn't handle unauthorized requests really well, so it will return 200 OK responses for many different actions that the user can make. You'll notice that if you'd try to cancel a disclosure request for a report that you're not the reporter or program member of, it won't actually cancel the request, even though the backend said it did. Because of that, I don't believe that this is a valid security vulnerability. Please let me know if you believe I missed something.",
