  "vulnerability_information": "The https://pos-channel.shopifycloud.com/graphql-proxy/admin endpoint allows us to update a staff email address that is having a Shopify ID.\n\nTaking that into consideration, if a store is setup to use **Google Apps** as login service and if a staff/store owner hasn't yet linked his account to a Google one (meaning he never logged in using Google), it is possible to update their email to our own Google email address resulting in us being able to log into their account. By doing so, our Google account ends up linked to the staff member/store owner. \n\n## Steps to reproduce \n1. As a staff member with **Point Of Sale** access, open up **Point of Sale** > **Staff** page and select the staff you want to link your Google account with.\n2. Open up your browser network inspection tab and save its profile. Copy the CURL request that is being made to https://pos-channel.shopifycloud.com/graphql-proxy/admin **StaffMemberUpdate** operation.\n3. From the copied CURL request, update the `email` field from the payload to your own email of the configured Google Apps domain.\n4. Logout from the store and log back in using the `Google Apps` email you just set.\n\n## Demo\n{F857469}\n\n## Impact\n\nRecently, maybe when you guys fixed [872380](https://hackerone.com/reports/872380),  [867513](https://hackerone.com/reports/867513) or some other reports, you also fixed updating the email address of a store owner using the **StaffMemberUpdate** operation of https://pos-channel.shopifycloud.com/graphql-proxy/admin endpoint. However, the shop owner himself is still able to update his email address using that endpoint. Thus, by leveraging a XSS targeting the shop owner, we would technically be able to link it to our Google account, giving us access to shop owner features as described on https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account\n{F857468}\n\nBesides that, without any XSS, that can exploited to link our Google account to any other staff account that isn't yet linked.",

We're awarding a $2,000 bounty for this issue.\n\nAlthough this technically falls into the \"Authentication bypass - login\" category for Shopify Core, there are mitigating factors which significantly reduce the impact of this vulnerability compared to previous authentication bypass issues:\n\n* The target store must have Google Apps enabled. Only a small fraction of our merchants use this setting.\n* The victim account can't already be a Google Apps user, and can't be the store owner.\n* The attacker must have an account on the target store, and must have Full Permissions. This means that the attack does not result in a privilege escalation.\n* The attacker must have a Google account on the associated Google Apps domain.\n\nFor these reasons, the bounty amount falls below the typical range for authentication bypass issues.\n\nOur engineering team is still working on deploying a fix. We'll be in touch again once the issue is resolved.",
