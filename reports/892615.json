  "vulnerability_information": "###Summary\nWhen sending too much data through file upload, the server returns an invalid 500 status code instead of the speed 429 status code, causing an internal denial of service.\n\n###Description\nI uploaded a file from the https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317 page to test the speed limit, bypass, problem, and hit submit to start testing the speed limit did. As a result, while investigating the problem, we found an interesting bug. First, I found that if I send too many requests to the server, a slow response and an internal denial of service occur with 500 status codes instead of 429 status codes.\n\nI knew that this would result in a real denial of service, and I immediately stopped testing. In addition, we found that when denial of service is activated through the 502 status code, some information is exposed. A report on the release of this information was rewritten by #892610.\n\n###Environment\n- Browser : Chrome Version 83.0.4103.56 (official build) beta (64-bit)\n- Scope: Web Application\n- Attack type: Denial of Service\n- Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges\n- Domain : https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317\n- Influence range : https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl\n\n###Proof of Concept\n{F856944}\n\n###Steps To Reproduce :\n1. Go to the https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl/vacatures/solliciteer/senior-hr-consultant-317 Page.\n2. Basically I need to upload a cv file when uploading the file. This is a normal cv file. Please upload this file {F856943}\n3. Submit a form upload a file, and grap the packet.\n4. Now we need to send too many requests to activate the 500 code.\n5. Send a lot of data through Burp Suite -> Intruder function.\n6. Now, when the 500th code is activated, the internal service denial occurs through the 502 status code.\n\n###Recommendation\nIf you send too many requests, the server should not have code 500 activated. Reimplement to enable the 429 status code.\n\n## Impact\n\nInternal denial of service leads to total denial of service within the web service https://www.werkenbijbakertilly.nl.",

Talent-soft determines the uploaded file is invalid and responds with a `400 Bad Request`\n6. The request on our application transforms the `400 Bad Request` to an exception and renders an error page to the user with status code 500.\n\nNow, offcourse this error handling could have been better to inform the visitor of failed upload data instead of an error page. But our server itself doesn't seem affected as I can confirm from the lack of downtime notices.\n\nCan you confirm the show data above is what you send? (approximately 424 times)",

The result was a 503 server error after 500 server errors, and very occasionally a 500 server error was returned after a 504 gateway. \n\n I was able to confirm once again that the previous report has been fixed so that the nginx version is not exposed.\n\n{F888839}\n\nI clearly noticed that the 502 gateway had occurred if I had tested it before, and at that time I immediately stopped testing and produced a report.\nThis is certain.\n\nHowever, as the problem was fixed so that the nginx server version was not exposed for any reason, the developer fixed the problem so that the 502 gateway did not occur, and through this, only the 503 server was returned and the problem seems to have been fixed.\n\nIn other words, if I tested it before, a 502 gateway occurred, and I told my other acquaintances to connect to the site to see if this was a problem I was alone. The acquaintance said that the site was unable to access because it had a 502 gateway, and this was not my problem on the network.\n\nI think this issue was valid at the time of the test and I am eligible for a bounty.\n\nAnd I really appreciate the bounty for the other two reports.\n\nFinally as you say\nNow I agree that this error handling from outside could be a good idea to inform the visitor of the failed upload data instead of the error page! \n\n\nThank you!!",

      "message": "Hey @what_web \n\nThanks for looking into this again and good to see you can confirm the nginx version isn't exposed anymore.\nDue to your test from half an hour ago we were able to looking into the issue while it was happening.\n\nIt seems to be a bit of a combination of circumstances (doesn't it always ;)\n\nWe do have a couple of mechanisms in place to balance the load on the servers and the sites.\nFor one: kubernetes monitors cpu-usage and will scale up when cpu gets to high\nSecond: pages are cached in several layers (varnish, redis, opcache etc)\nThird: The loadbalancer will throttle insane traffic\n\nNow looking at this report and prior findings about the request to talent-soft.com I can conclude the following:\nDuring a request to an external server, our application waits for the external server to respond. This waiting is very low in resources. This means cpu won't spike with a lot of request and also means kubernetes won't kick in.\n\nPOST request can't be cached for obvious reasons, so that caching layer is useless here.\n\nThe loadbalancer also doesn't kick in since you actually don't need all that many requests to get all available pods working on your POST requests. Besides, whether something is 'a lot of request' isn't for the loadbalancer to know. It's something only the application knows.\n\nAll in all that means this ticket has a lot of the same surface area as https://hackerone.com/reports/882942\nIt isn't exactly the same, since that POST is handled internally by our application and no external server comes into play. But what is the same, is the solution.\n\nSince POST to /vacature-alert (see https://hackerone.com/reports/882942) is able to process a lot of requests, you don't get to see a 50x error. The solution there is - as commented there - a middleware in the application for throttling requests\n\nIn this report, the application isn't able to process the requests in a timely manner due to an external server dependency which we can't easily get around (and shouldn't have to). Which results in all available request handlers being busy with waiting, resulting in a 50x status for new requests. Here the solution is the same: a middleware to throttle requests.\n\nI thank you for being helpful and looking into this. I will assign my colleague to assign bounty to this report as well. Even though the solution is the same, the origin of the issue is not.",

Due to integrations with an external service, the request had to wait for response of the third party server in order to return response to the applying visitor. Doing a lot of POSTs in a row caused a lot of waiting time due to curl waits. This caused the application to not respond in a timely manner\n\nThe fix was to implement a middleware which throttles requests when 'too many' requests are send. The 'too many' can be configured based on the needs of the application.\n",
