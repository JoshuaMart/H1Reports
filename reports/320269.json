(`npm@6` is an active release candidate but in the meantime `npm@5` remains supported.) `npm` has 1908 dependents published on the registry. It is unknown how many use it as a library versus calling it as a cli. Some do, despite this being an unsupported mode of operation.\n\n`npmconf` has been deprecated since (at least) Jan 2016 and has been entirely unsupported since then.

But `npmconf` [Readme](https://github.com/npm/npmconf#this-package-is-deprecated) redirects there:\n\n> npm itself is the best tool to use to manage its configuration\n\nNext (*needed to break the citation*):\n\n> and added a username and password pair where the password was a Number\n\nCorrect.\n\n> and then you called save(). At which point uninitialized memory from that process would be written to the user running the process's .npmrc.\n\nNot entirely correct — `.save` call is not required. Please see the code snippets attached above — it is also a risk when someone does that in-memory, which could be more likely than writing to a file.\n\n> npm had a patch that coincidentally fixed this in v6.0.0-next.0, and I'd be happy to bring that patch npm@5 as well. \n\nGreat, SGTM for npm@5 and npm@6.\n\n> npmconf has been deprecated since (at least) Jan 2016 and has been entirely unsupported since then\n\nCoincidentally, Jan 2016 was the date of the original report to security@npmjs.com ;-). According to the git history, `npmconf` has been deprecated before the report, about for two weeks.\n\nAt the current time, what worries me about `npmconf` is its downloads/month stats rising over time — seems like the deprecation message upon install is not effective.\n\nI am not sure if that should be fixed or just disclosed with adding to vuln databases and changing the deprecation message to something more effective  — any approach would work to me. I understand the negative effects of making it seem that an unsupported package is supported, and I trust your opinion on that whatever path you choose here. Imo, even simply disclosing this issue might help a bit.\n\n> I would be genuinely surprised if anyone using npm internals as a library or npmconf called setCredentialsByURI.\n\nI have found signs of that usage, though I assume it's fairly minimal, e.g. https://github.com/ctran/nexus-cli/blob/master/index.js#L124 would fit for «anyone», or https://github.com/HelloWallet/secret-service/blob/master/lib/modules.js#L334-L339. There seem to be more — but not a lot of them in public packages, so yes, for public packages the usage seems minimal.\n\nNikita.",
