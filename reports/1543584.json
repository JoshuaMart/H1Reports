  "vulnerability_information": "### Summary\nMoving an issue with a specially-crafted description results in high CPU usage for 60 seconds (request timeout).\nMultiple requests can be issued in parallel to create a larger impact.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Given an authorized user (on GitLab.com - anyone can self-register. On EE - depends on instance configuration).\n2. Create an issue with the following description (provided a one-line python script to avoid bloating):\n3. Once created, move the issue to a different project.\n\nThe script:\n```python -c \"print('![l' * 100000 + '\\n')\"```\nNote: works with a lower number of repetitions too.\n\n\n### Impact\nAfter 60 seconds (timeout) - the request fails.\nMeanwhile, on the server end, (a single) CPU is burnt out (verified against a local EE instance).\nIssuing multiple requests in parallel (on multiple GitLab issues) results in multiple CPUs burn out.\nUsing the DockerHub image, the entire server is completely unavailable by repeatedly sending a small number of requests repeatedly.\n\n### Examples\nThe bug is instance-independent, works on latest versions. Since GitLab.com is open-core - it would work on GitLab too.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\nThe HTTP request fails for timeout while the server is burning CPU.\n\nOn the code side:\nlib/gitlab/gfm/uploads_rewriter.rb / module Gitlab/Gfm / class UploadsRewriter / function files:\n```@text.scan(@pattern)```\nWhere FileUploader::MARKDOWN_PATTERN is assigned to the pattern data member.\n\nMARKDOWN_PATTERN is: \n```\\!?\\[.*?\\]\\(/uploads/(?<secret>[0-9a-f]{32})/(?<file>.*?)\\)```\nThe pattern is of a polynomial complexity, thus, the scan results in high CPU utilization.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\nInstead of using Ruby’s default Regex engine, use the RE2 engine (or the wrapped version at lib/gitlab/untrusted_regexp.rb), with the following pattern:\n```\\!?\\[.*\\]\\(/uploads/([0-9a-f]{32})/(.*)\\)```\nAs RE2 does not go beyond O(n), this scan becomes linear.\nNote: since RE2 does not support named captures, all references should be fixed - assigning the results to secret/identifier local variables.### Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n### Output of checks\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n## Impact\n\nA complete denial of service of a GitLab EE instance.\nAs this vulnerability impacts GitLab.com, we assume that this vulnerability opens the door for a DDOS attack.",

This vulnerability is a REDoS, which on your pre-submission message box explicitly mentioned as “usually fine” - why doesn’t it apply in this case?\n2. Since e.g.https://hackerone.com/reports/1283484 has a very similar impact and flow, we were convinced this vulnerability would be resolved as well. Could you explain what makes the difference?\n3. Does Gitlab state that the software is exposed to DoS/REDoS flaws, which cannot be fixed by rate limits? We provide security services for GitLab (and other SCM services). We haven’t found any statements of this kind, and if that is the case, we’d redesign the protection mechanisms needed to deal with GitLab instances.\n4. Both reports 1543718 and 1543606 were closed as duplicates of this issue. The reports are different from this one in both exploitation entry points and in the code flow (root cause). Why are these considered duplicates then?\n\nThank you,\n@legit-security",

Using your python script to generate the input with 100000 repetitions makes for a slow move but it doesn't time out in my local instance. Furthermore, generating the input with 'abc' instead of '![l' doesn't seem to make any difference in the time.  If I make an issue with repetitions of 'abc' of sufficient length I can get it to time out upon moving the issue. So I'm not sure this is REDoS and might just be due to the length of the input. Can you try again using version 14.10.2 and try it with both your crafted input and also a plain string? A video would be great, in case I'm missing some detail in your POC.\n\nCheers,\n@kmorrison\nGitLab Security Team",

Sorry for not providing a more straight-forward sample.\nYou can use e.g. 900k repetitions of ‘x’ to demonstrate that the issue is not with the length of the input but the RE expression.\nWe attached a demo to show that using 900k of ‘x’ works perfectly and the issue moves in seconds,\nwhilst repetitions of ‘a’ (another attack string) cause the issue to fail to move and cause high CPU utilization.\nPlease let us know if there’s anything else we can do to make things clearer.\nThanks,\n@legit-security",

This is probably why it didn’t reproduce in your tests.\n\nNow, the new attack vector created with the fix is the `/clone` attack vector:\nSince the patch moves the usage of the markdown pattern to the notes’ cloning code, it becomes the new trigger.\nSo, the new attack flow is:\n* Create an issue with the repeated `[!l` payload.\n* Comment e.g.: `/clone --with_notes same_user/same_org`\n\nYou should note that the patch changes the MARKDOWN_PATTERN usage from `scan` to `match`.\nWe're not sure if that change was intentional, but anyway, it did impact the attack string: the repeated `a` payload cannot be used to exploit it anymore, and only the repeated `[!l` payload can be used now.\n\nWe'd be glad to hear your reply to our open questions, and please let us know if there's any further explanation needed regarding this new attack vector (and root cause).\nThank you,\n@legit-security",
