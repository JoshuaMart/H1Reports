  "vulnerability_information": "In the program portal, there is an option to add external people as participants in a bug report. The admin can then remove this person as well if needed.\r\n\r\nThe request for removing an external reporter looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDELETE /reports/<report_id>/external_users/<user_id> HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: hackerone.com\r\nUser-Agent: <redacted>\r\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\r\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\r\nX-CSRF-Token: <redacted>\r\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\r\nReferer: <redacted>\r\nCookie: <redacted>\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt was observed that by simply changing the value of `<user_id>` in the above URL, it is possible to generate a delete notification for the user associated with that particular user id even though that user was never invited as a participant for that bug report in the first place. \r\n\r\nPossible Impact(s):\r\n* Due to the above request being sent, an email gets sent via the HackerOne portal to that particular user notifying them of their removal. See screenshot 1. It is possible to send such emails on a mass scale to all HackerOne users. I haven't tried this but I think this can be done. The email originating from the HackerOne platform will look legitimate but the users will be clueless as to what caused their removal from a report to which they were never invited.\r\n\r\n* A malicious admin can possibly generate notifications within a bug report of removing participants which they never added which might be a little confusing to other admins/participants. See screenshot 2 where I was able to remove certain folks without inviting them. I apologize for the 2 emails that were sent out to two different HackerOne researchers accidentally. I was just testing and didn't realize that this would actually work. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n/ab",

So, here goes:\n\nWhen an admin invites other team members, the admin can choose whether to conceal or reveal that team member's identity. If the membership is concealed, it is clearly stated under Visibility that this should only allow the team member to post internal comments and prevents the team member from performing any public actions. See screenshot.\n\nHowever, it was observed that this concealed team member could add/remove external reporters. This team member could also add public comments to a bug report that were visible to the reporters as well. This shouldn't have happened because the visibility was concealed and this team member was only supposed to post internal comments. \n\nSo, I wanted to highlight the fact that apart from mass spamming as mentioned above, concealed team members could add/remove external reporters as well.\n\nLet me know if that warrants a separate bug or not.\n\nCheers!\n/ab",
