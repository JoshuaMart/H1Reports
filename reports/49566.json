  "vulnerability_information": "Hi Hackerone,\r\n\r\nI have found a vulnerability wherein once a Team manager of any team sends out an Invitation to another Hackerone user to join his team, the invited team member gets auto accepted into the team to which he is being invited to join. \r\n\r\nThe choice of \"Accept\" or \"Reject\" invitation which should have been displayed to the invited hackerone user is not not being displayed and the invited user without his knowledge becomes a Team member of the invited team\r\n\r\nThe above scenario will only happen when the invited user is not logged into his hackeone account. Once the invited user gets an email notification regarding the invite, he will just simply click on the invitation link provided in the mail.\r\n\r\nThe link will redirect the user to hackerone page wherein he either has to \"Create\" new hackerone account or Sign In with an existing hackerone account.\r\n\r\nOnce the user signs in with existing hackerone account, the automatically becomes a Team member of the invited team\r\n\r\nVulnerability:\r\n===========\r\nThe invited hackerone user should have been directed to a page where he should decide to 'Accept' or 'Reject' the invitation. But since the above page was not being displayed, he became a member even though he didn't wanted to be or he wanted to reject.\r\n\r\nHope this is clear enough. Do note that the above scenario only works if the invited hackerone user is not currently logged into Hackerone when he received the invitation.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nVivin Joseph",

User1 invites  User2 to be a member of his Team called \"Test\"(https://hackerone.com/vivin123)\n\n2. User2 gets email about the invite.\n\n3. User2 click on the \"View Invitation\" Link.\n\n4. User2 is redirected to a page where he can select to \"Accept\" or \"Reject\" invitation.\n\n5. User2 decides to choose either of the options depending on his decision. This is because User2 has the ultimate authority to decide if to join a team or not join the team.\n\nThe above is the accepted workflow as intended by Hackerone.\n\n\nScenario [2] -- Vulnerable Workflow when the invited user is not authenticated on to his Hackerone Account.\n************************************************************************************\n\n1. User1 invites  User2 to be a member of his Team called \"Test\"(https://hackerone.com/vivin123)\n\n2. User2 gets email about the invite.\n\n3. User2 click on the \"View Invitation\" Link.\n\n4. User2 is navigated to page where he either has to complete the action by choosing between \"Use Existing account\" or \"Create New Account\".\n\n5. User2 clicks on \"Use Existing Account\" and get navigated to Hackerone login page.\n\n6. User2 enter valid login credentials and signs into his Hackerone account.\n\n7. It was observed that Hackerone auto accepted the received invitation from User1 and User2 was navigated to the Test Team's(https://hackerone.com/vivin123) report page.\n\nObservations:\n* From the above it was very clear that Hackerone bypassed the \"Accept\" or \"Reject\" page for the invitation. \n* If the \"Accept\" or \"Reject\" decision was available to logged in user in Scenario[1], then the same should have been displayed to user in Scenario[2].\n\nConclusion:\nThe decision of \"Accepting\" or \"Rejecting\" an invitation should entirely rest with the invited User. Therefore, Hackerone must must correct its design flaw of auto approval of invitations(Scenario 2) and present to the user the interface for \"Accepting\" or \"Rejecting\" an invitation.\n",

      "message": "An Interesting Exploit:\n=======================\n\nWhen you create a Hackerone Team, by default you will become its Team manager. You cannot leave the team unless you invite someone else and assign that user as the Team Manager. Suppose you(User1) want to leave the team of which you are the only single manager, then by following the above steps as mentioned in Scenario[2], you can force another hackerone user(User2) to become a Team Manager(While sending the invite, Check the \"Manage Team\" check box).\n\nTherefore, going with scenario[2], if User2 receives an invite to join a team and logins into his hackerone account, he automatically becomes the new manager of the Team. At this very moment, User1 can leave the Team as his \"Leave Team\" link becomes enabled. User1 immediately clicks \"Leave Team\" and exsits from the team he created.\n\nUnkowing of what permissions was given to User2 by User1, if User2 now wants to leave the Team which he was forced joined automatically by Hackerone, he wouldn't be able to leave the team as he has become the new \"Team Manager\"(Its mandatory for each team to have minimum of 1 Team manager) \n\nUser2 can only leave the team if he invites someone else(say User3) as the manager and that they(User3) accepts the invitation.\n\nInshort, User2 became the Team Manager of a Team which he didn't intend to join in the first place.Also due to the fact that he is now a Team Manager, he cannot leave the Team as there isn't anyone else as Team Manager in the Team. \n\nThis is a serious design issue.

Please review the exploit which i have provided as this scenario is all aspects should warrant a reward.\n\nI am again giving you the exploit,\n\nAn Interesting Exploit:\n\nWhen you create a Hackerone Team, by default you will become its Team manager. You cannot leave the team unless you invite someone else and assign that user as the Team Manager. Suppose you(User1) want to leave the team of which you are the only single manager, then by following the above steps as mentioned in Scenario[2], you can force another hackerone user(User2) to become a Team Manager(While sending the invite, Check the \"Manage Team\" check box).\n\nTherefore, going with scenario[2], if User2 receives an invite to join a team and logins into his hackerone account, he automatically becomes the new manager of the Team. At this very moment, User1 can leave the Team as his \"Leave Team\" link becomes enabled. User1 immediately clicks \"Leave Team\" and exsits from the team he created.\n\nUnkowing of what permissions was given to User2 by User1, if User2 now wants to leave the Team which he was forced joined automatically by Hackerone, he wouldn't be able to leave the team as he has become the new \"Team Manager\"(Its mandatory for each team to have minimum of 1 Team manager)\n\nUser2 can only leave the team if he invites someone else(say User3) as the manager and that they(User3) accepts the invitation.\n\nInshort, User2 became the Team Manager of a Team which he didn't intend to join in the first place.Also due to the fact that he is now a Team Manager, he cannot leave the Team as there isn't anyone else as Team Manager in the Team. \n\n\nI still believe that by the above method, an attacker was still able to control the victim to do an unwanted operation on his hackerone handle..",
