  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\n\n`Trace.axd` leaks sensitive information on `██████████` by allowing signed in users to view previous requests sent to the webserver.\n\n## Impact\n\nInformation leaked includes (but is not limited to):\n- full names\n- email addresses\n- social security numbers\n- dates of birth\n- plaintext passwords\n- cookies, session tokens, and CSRF tokens\n- IP addresses and headers\n- application specific information (endpoints, files and directories on the filesystem, software versions, )\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Visit https://████████/Gateway/sso.aspx and sign in. Note that any user can create a user (and any privilege level works for this vulnerability as long as a user is signed in), so this should be considered an unauthenticated vulnerability.\n2. Visit https://██████████/████/Trace.axd\n3. Click on `View Details` for any request that seems interesting. You can find social security numbers by visiting any of the `/candidate_app/dspstatus.aspx` pages and then Ctrl+F'ing for `app_ssn`.\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\nDisable `Trace.axd`. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/articles/ms972204(v=msdn.10)\n\n## Impact\n\nAny attacker can potentially access the following information of current or future Navy personnel:\n- full names\n- email addresses\n- social security numbers\n- dates of birth\n- plaintext passwords\n- cookies, session tokens, and CSRF tokens\n- IP addresses and headers\n- application specific information (endpoints, files and directories on the filesystem, software versions, )",
