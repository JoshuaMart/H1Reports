  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nHi there, I discovered that jarvis-new.urbanclap.com uses a weak Flask session key. Because Flask sessions are signed with a static secret, if this secret is known to an attacker then they can modify the session state. In this case, we can modify the Redash `user_id` for the session and log in as any user. **This results in a full compromise of the instance.** I have attached a screenshot showing that I logged into `█████████@urbancompany.com` and have full admin permissions:\n\n██████████\n████\n██████████\n███████\n\n## How to fix\nChange the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` to a random value immediately.\n\n## PoC\nFor simplicity, it is easiest to forge a password reset link for Redash. We can do this with a bit of Python. To get the reset link for user ID 1, we simply run:\n```\n>>> from itsdangerous import URLSafeTimedSerializer, SignatureExpired, BadSignature\n>>> serializer = URLSafeTimedSerializer(\"███\")\n>>> serializer.dumps(str(\"1\"))\n'███'\n```\n\nThen, we can browse to `https://jarvis-new.urbanclap.com/reset/█████` and choose a new password for user ID 1. This then logs us into their account.\n\n## Impact\n\nSince this is connected to all of your databases, this is likely a significant leak of PII and other sensitive information. This is easily a critical issue.",
