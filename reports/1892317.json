  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary:\nHi team,\n\nIt was found a xss reflected in your web asset.\n\nReflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) occur when an attacker injects browser executable code within a single HTTP response.When a web application is vulnerable to this type of attack, it will pass unvalidated input sent through requests back to the client.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Access the url `https://███.aspx/%22%20onmouseover=%22prompt(1)%22%20x=%22`\n  2. See the popup in the screen\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n[list any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)]\n\n  * [attachment / reference]\n\n\n███\n\n## Impact\n\n## Impact\n* An attacker that can control the code executed in a victim browser can usually fully compromise this victim. This includes :\n* Perform any action within the application that the user can perform.\n* Modify any information that the user is able to modify.\n* Steal user cookies\n* Redirect to phishing site\n* Arbitrary requests - An attacker can use XSS to send requests that appear to be from the victim to the web server.\n* Malware download - XSS can prompt the user to download malware. Since the prompt looks like a legitimate request from the\nsite, the user may be more likely to trust the request and actually install the malware.\n* Run Arbitrary javascript code into victim's browser\n\n## System Host(s)\n██████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\n\n\n## CVE Numbers\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Access the url `https://███████.aspx/%22%20onmouseover=%22prompt(1)%22%20x=%22`\n  2. See the popup in the screen\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\n\n",
