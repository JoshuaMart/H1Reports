  "vulnerability_information": "A vulnerability exists in Slack's call functionality that allows a team member to eavesdrop on private ongoing Slack calls by inviting themselves into the conversation without the permission from either participant. By doing so they can eavesdrop on co-workers' private conversations as well as taking part in these conversations. To make the attack less obvious, the attacker could re-use Slackbot's avatar and choose a username that is similar to Slackbot. Another scenario would be to pick the avatar of the person you want to impersonate and choose a username that is similar to theirs. \n\n## Setup\nBefore trying to reproduce the vulnerability, make sure you have the following:\n- Slack Calls should be enabled in your Slack instance.\n- Have at least two accounts you control. One we will call the Main Account, the other one we will call the Eavesdropper Account.\n- Have at least two accounts you do not control on the same Slack instance. They will be used to mock the situation of two co-workers having a private Slack call.\n- For easy reproduction, it is advised to initiate the call from a web browser rather than a native app.\n- Make sure to have some type of intercepting proxy running that allows you to record HTTP requests and replay them easily.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n### Obtaining the vulnerable request\nFirst off, we are going to obtain the exact request to the endpoint that contains the vulnerability (`/api/screenhero.rooms.invite`). This will be needed to later on modify and add Eavesdropper Account to the private call. \n\nSet up a call and invite someone to the call. Make sure to capture the request to `/api/screenhero.rooms.invite` and save it so you can replay it easily later. The request should look something like:\n\n```\nPOST /api/screenhero.rooms.invite?_x_id=91700980-1479951838.521 HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackerone.slack.com\nOrigin: https://hackerone.slack.com\nX-Slack-Version-Ts: 1479949022\n[...]\n\nis_video_call=false&responder=U0254GYNR&room=R36L2K8P6&set_active=true&should_share=true&token=<snip>\n```\n\n### Staging the attack environment\nStart by setting up a 1:1 call between two users (both accounts you don't necessarily have control over). This is to mock a situation where two co-workers are on a private 1:1 Slack call. \n\nNote the Screenhero room ID of the call. You will need this later. In this scenario, I am going to assume the attacker is already in possession of the room ID. The room ID can be recognized by the ID after `/call/` in https://hackerone.slack.com/call/R36L2K8P6 (an example).\n\n### Pulling off the attack\nTake the request you saved earlier, and now modify the request as follows:\n- change the value of the `room` parameter to the room ID you noted from the previous step\n- change the value of the `responder` to the user ID of Eavesdropper Account. The reason why this can't be your own user ID (Main Account) is that you're not allowed to invite `self`. \n\nAfter these changes, forward the request and wait for a call on Eavesdropper Account. When you accept this call, you will be placed into the private conversation the two victims were having. \n\nLet me know if there's anything else you need to validate this issue.\n",

You can do so by exploiting a similar endpoint that shares out the private call to a channel (using the privileges of Main Account, who is not a part of this private call). Specifically, the endpoint is `/api/screenhero.rooms.share`.\n\nHere's the request to do it:\n\n```\nPOST /api/screenhero.rooms.share?_x_id=8e49d942-1479956683.974 HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackerone.slack.com\nOrigin: https://hackerone.slack.com\nX-Slack-Version-Ts: 1479953760\n[...]\n\nchannel=C076H6VUY&room=R36LPPX9T&set_active=true&token=<snip>\n```\n\nThis will share out the private call between two co-workers (or a private channel) to channel with ID `C076H6VUY`.

That indeed doesn't work.\n\nPlease make sure the request you are intercepting and modifying is to the `/api/screenhero.rooms.invite` endpoint. \n\nAnyway, I simplified my PoC a bit by instead using the `/api/screenhero.rooms.share` endpoint since it contains the same vulnerability:\n\n1. Create a channel (public or private) with only yourself in it. Start a call in this channel, don't invite anyone. Simply go to the share icon in the top left corner and share the call to the channel you created. Grab this request and save it for later.\n2. Now your two victims, User 1 and User 2 set up a call between them. In my PoC I started the call from a DM conversation, not a channel. *Note the room ID.*\n3. Now repeat the request you grabbed from step 1 and replace the room ID with the one from your two victims. The request should look like this:\n\n```\nPOST /api/screenhero.rooms.share?_x_id=a8694c39-1480371978.203 HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackerone.slack.com\n[...]\n\nchannel=C076H6VUY&room=R37T38N3V&set_active=true&token=<snip>\n```\n\n^-- of course make sure that your own token is inserted here (`xoxs-....`), otherwise it will fail. \n\nAfter you repeat this request, the call that was going on between your two victims (User 1 and User 2) is shared to the channel you created. Just click the message posted there and you can join the call. \n\n*Note that the user where I am performing this attack from is a Slack Admin user.* \n\n",
