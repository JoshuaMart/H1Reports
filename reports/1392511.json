      "message": "Hi @tk0 - thanks again for bringing this to our attention! Thankfully, we also received some of emails from the staging environment ourselves -- but we did see your report before we got to those emails, so you were the first to notify us.\n\nWe kicked off incident response right after I triaged your report. We just concluded our root cause analysis. Here's what happened:\n\nThis week, HackerOne's Infrastructure team had planned a test of our disaster recovery (DR) process. Earlier this morning, the team spun up a staging environment of our application in a different AWS datacenter. Due to how the data synchronization between those zones work, the team did not have access to a copy of the staging database. To complete the DR process, they used a production snapshot to restore the database from. This happened at 8:15a PT. Every week at 10:00a PT, a cron job kicks off a job to update the rewards that use HackerOne's smart rewards feature. At 10:00a PT today, the staging environment with the production database snapshot and HackerOne's production environment both started the job - resulting in emails being sent from production and from the staging environment. Asynchronous job processing for the temporary staging environment ceased at 10:58a PT. The entire environment is scheduled to be deleted later today.\n\nThe incident response team audited all cron jobs that were executed between 8:15a and 10:58a PT. Three of those had possible external side effects. One of the cron jobs was a task that would poll for changes for one of the platform's API integrations. When looking closer at this integration, the team noticed that some API integrations were still active for churned customers. We're treating this as a security vulnerability, which we will award you a bounty for as well.\n\nIn total, 1,051 HackerOne users received a notification from the temporary HackerOne's staging environment. The actual domain our staging environment is hosted on, https://enorekcah.com/, is behind the Duo Network Gateway. This means that only HackerOne employees were able to access the application. However, HackerOne employees could not have authenticated to the system due to a mismatch between the SAML public key and HackerOne's SSO provider. At no point was any confidential information exposed.\n\nThis year's DR test yields some great learnings. :) The team will collect all action items from the test, including the one you've brought to our attention, and figure out a solution how to improve going forward.",
