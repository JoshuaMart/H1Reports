      "message": "Well, few thoughts after taking another look of things.\n\n1. I found out that a legit password reset request returns 302 - Found, and the crafted long request returns 200, it seemed weird. \nafter Rendering the page it showed me that there is some sort of attempt to implement letter cap (254 for email) by the developers, but ofcourse it had been bypassed by capturing and crafting the request, as you can see on my images ( i believe the developers didn't mean the server to process the crafted long requests - when you implement a block).\n\n2. I found out that my first 2 accounts, which one got ~850 mails and the other ~350, wont get any more mails, i wonder if the developers blocked my accounts because of my reports here, or i could block anyone's ability to reset his password by bruteforcing his details.\n\n3. I managed to DDOS the website again, checked with another network.\nImages are attached.\nThe \"SPIKE\" Image shows clearly - requests got stuck, then changed to 5XX, then returned to normal 302.\n",
