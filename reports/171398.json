We've ensured all auth-related endpoints are no longer exempt from the external link warning interstitial, as per your last comment, which should alleviate this concern.\n\nWe also discussed the Login CSRF inherit in IdP-initiated sessions with several other companies, and we continue to feel that bypassing CSRF checks is an accepted risk for the user experience of SSO via SAML. This may change in the future if this begins to be exploited somehow.\n\nI think this covers everything you've mentioned, so let me know if I've missed something.",
