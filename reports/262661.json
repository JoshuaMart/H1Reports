  "vulnerability_information": "Hi HackerOne Team,\n\n**Summary:**\n\nI have found an IDOR on HackerOne feedback review functionality, below are the following issues.\n\n- Security teams can create public feedback to the hacker which is did not submit any report to them, please note that public feedback will be seen on hackers profile.\n\n- Information Disclosure, the hacker will be able to see the __private feedback__ and the __report title__ that will be sent to his email even that is not his report title.\n\nLets focus on the first one which have direct security risk to all hackers, because it can be used to downgrade their profile reputations using the \"__What Programs Say__\"\n\n**Description (Include impact)**:\n\nA malicious user can create a public review to any hackers that he wants using the IDOR on hacker review functionality, the public review will be displayed on the hackers profile, therefor if the malicious person creates a disgusting review, all hackerone users can see that on victims user profile \"__What Programs Say__\", and may downgrade the users profile reputation.\n\n**Steps to reproduce**:\n\nPlease note that i ask permission to the following persons below, before i reproduce my findings:\n\n- @phspade a bug hunting buddy and a close friend of mine from Parrot Sec (who is the PH ambassador of Parrot Security OS and one of the sec team member who handle reports on Parrot Sec program)\n\n- @jong_jong my other half <3\n\nLets proceed to the steps to reproduce:\n\n  1. I used @jong_jong accounts to submit test report to Parrot Sec program.\n  2. @phspade closed my test report then i ask him to review me and give him some instruction to perfrom an IDOR.\n  3. @phspade click the review button and put the below necessary info: Selected `Friendliness` radio button, __Public feedback:__ `Japz is awesome :)`, __Private feedback:__ `Thanks for your report.`\n  4. Submit the report and capture the request, on __POST /hacker_reviews HTTP/1.1__ you will see this parameters with it's values `hacker_username=jong_jong&report_id=<redacted>&positive=true&behavior=friendly&private_feedback=Thanks+for+your+report.`\n  5. The vulnerable param is the __hacker_username__ , change the  value to victims username. (e.g `hacker_username=japzdivino`) and forward the request.\n  \n__japzdivino__ will received an email notification regarding the review, but it should be jong_jong should be the one to received\n\n{F215257}\n\nAlso japz profile will display the public review, instead of jong_jong's profile.\n\n{F215258}\n\nLet me know if anything else is needed.\n\nRegards\nJapz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Lets say jobert submitted a test report\n  2. rockyrobot closed jobert's test report\n  3. rockyrobot will review/feedback jobert's test report\n  4. capture the request and change `hacker_username=jobert` to `hacker_username=japzdivino`\n  5.

      "message": "Hi @japzdivino, thanks for bringing this to our attention! Here is what's happening: the endpoint takes both a username and a report ID. It first looks up if there's already a review for that particular report. If not, it'll see if you're authorized to write a review for that report. Then, it'll do a separate query to see if you can write a review for the user. This isn't tied to the report, so you are able to write a review for someone that didn't submit the report. However, the user still needs to have submitted a report to ANY of the programs you manage (verified programs). Even though it's an odd way of checking whether you can review the user, I wouldn't say it's a vulnerability. The title is disclosed in the email, but if a team member wants to send the report title to someone, they can already do that. It sounds like this turns out not to be a security vulnerability. Perhaps I'm missing something, so please let me know what you think. Thanks!",

This isn't tied to the report, so you are able to write a review for someone that didn't submit the report.\n\nThe review/feedback is for the hackers who submitted that report (when the report is already closed), but the wrong thing is, i can re-route the feedback to the hacker (participants/victim) but the victims report was not yet touched by the team, means the status is still `New` , the review is the overall interaction to the hackers, so it is wrong to allow to review the hackers who's report was not yet touched by the sec team. It is a clear IDOR.\n\n>Even though it's an odd way of checking whether you can review the user, I wouldn't say it's a vulnerability.\n\nI have to disagree a bit on this, because there is a direct impact to all program participants, either good or bad reputations using the \"__What Program Say__\".\n\nImagine that i can create a public review to the hackers who do not have resolved reports yet on a program.\n\n>The title is disclosed in the email, but if a team member wants to send the report title to someone, they can already do that. It sounds like this turns out not to be a security vulnerability. \n\nI agree on this, that is why I focused on the first scenario which have direct security risk to all hackers which is participating to any program (participants).\n\nI think you have to revisit the separate query that checks if you can write a review for the user\n\nLet me know if you need more info.\n\nRegards\nJapz",

There was no security risk because we found that programs could only leave feedback for hackers who are already on their program. This eliminated the cross-team feedback IDOR threat that was the original concern. We decided to put a fix in place to avoid potential security vulnerabilities in the future.\n\nWe really appreciate your report and hope that you'll report more to us in the future. Thanks for thinking of HackerOne security and enjoy the swag!",
