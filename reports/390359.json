We believe transparency is in the public's best interest in these extreme cases.```\n\nPlease don't get me wrong, i am more than willing to wait even longer if its required however by the end of the month (when 6 months have passed) i have been more than 'patient' and could in theory disclose it myself in order to finally claim my CVE number which has been reserved for the past months.\n\nBut note that refusing to disclose this report + mention the CVE number as reference in disclosure after 6 months would be unreasonable towards me, this report has been resolved for a while now and it will no longer be fair to keep me waiting.\n\nif you still believe this is a matter of national security and you insist on not disclosing this report than i am willing to extend the time but then i do want a disclosure timeline.\n\nI hope you can understand that this is important for me as security researcher.\n\nThank you for understanding.\n\nBest Regards,\nJoel Aviad Ossi\n\nReference:\n[1] https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines \n",
